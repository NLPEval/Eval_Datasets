The call for animal rights , however, envisages further-reaching consequences than the call to take account of both animal interests and human interests.	0
Singer's position is pathocentric, meaning that he calls for the attribution of an equal moral status to all living creatures with a capacity for feeling.

Singer's position is pathocentric, meaning that he calls for the attribution of an equal moral status to all living creatures with a capacity for feeling.	At stake here, then, is the question of whether the concept of rights - as it exists with respect to humans - can and should be extended to parts of the animal world.	0
Singer's position is pathocentric, meaning that he calls for the attribution of an equal moral status to all living creatures with a capacity for feeling.	Were animals to possess individual moral rights like humans, animal experiments would then be ruled out even if they promised an outstanding benefit - just as (forcibly conducted) experiments on humans are unacceptable under all circumstances irrespective of the benefit for the common good.	0

Living beings capable of suffering also include animals whose need for protection Schopenhauer nonetheless esteems to be lower than that of the human being.	0
Analogously to the justification of meat consumption, he nonetheless allows for animal experiments if they cause almost no pain and are essential for the survival of the human being.	This owes to the fact that a living being’s ability to suffer is dependent upon its intelligence and that it is hence the human being who possesses the highest quality of suffering.	0
Analogously to the justification of meat consumption, he nonetheless allows for animal experiments if they cause almost no pain and are essential for the survival of the human being.	According to this, meat consumption and the keeping of farm animals are legitimate as long as a death free of pain is warranted and the consumption is essential for survival, and, in the second case, the keeping of the animals is not excessive.	1

Concerning the issue of the legitimacy of animal experiments, the following standpoint arises in Wolf’s argumentation: The higher value of the human being based on empirical facts such as an allegedly higher ability to suffer due to her intelligence is rejected by Wolf as morally irrelevant; according to Wolf, they do not justify a gradation in status and hence no animal experiments which cause suffering to animals.	0
Analogously to the justification of meat consumption, he nonetheless allows for animal experiments if they cause almost no pain and are essential for the survival of the human being.	Similar to proponents of the animal rights position, approaches to the ethics of commission are oftentimes being criticized by means of the argument that moral consideration is only sensible concerning those living beings that are capable of moral consideration; this means that due to their capability, only human beings should be included in the circle of those that are directly worthy of protection.	0
Analogously to the justification of meat consumption, he nonetheless allows for animal experiments if they cause almost no pain and are essential for the survival of the human being.

Many people in the United States believe that adopting a system for regulating organ trading similar to Iran's will help to decrease the national shortage of kidneys.	With presumed consent laws (also known as opt out laws), consent for organ donation is assumed upon death unless the individual previously opted out by submitting documentation.	0

For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	These findings are unsurprising, given the unpleasant physical effects of exposure to concentrated tobacco smoke.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	However, public opinion is also being galvanized by growing recognition of the adverse health effects of second-hand smoke, something the tobacco industry has striven hard to refute as part of a campaign sustained over many years to prevent the introduction of bans on smoking in public places.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	There is now an overwhelming consensus among independent tobacco researchers that exposure to second-hand smoke causes many deaths, with recent research using more precise measures of exposure revealing how exposure to second-hand smoke is considerably more dangerous than was previously believed.3 This is consistent with recently discovered tobacco industry documents showing that second-hand smoke is even more harmful, volume for volume, than directly inhaled smoke.4 Yet the industry continues to place the highest priority on preventing the introduction of restrictions on smoking in public places and has been especially active in spreading misinformation about the effects of the bans in Ireland and New York.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	The main reason it has pursued this policy with such tenacity is clear; bans, together with increased taxation, are the most effective ways of reducing smoking overall.5 However, it is also concerned that to concede that second-hand smoke is harmful would undermine its argument that smoking is a matter of personal choice.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	The strategy pursued by the industry has several elements.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	One, now largely discredited, has been to attack the link between second-hand smoking and disease has included commissioning research, some of which was fraudulent and some simply designed to mislead, undermining the communication of research showing the harm caused by second-hand smoke, and lobbying governments and regulators.6,7	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	Another is to argue that any irritation (again denying the possibility of harm) can be dealt with by ventilation.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	This too is incorrect, with extensive evidence that the force of ventilation that would be required is far beyond the capacity of existing systems and would be similar to sitting outside during a gale.8 It is important to be aware that many harmful components of tobacco smoke are odourless and the tobacco industry has put much effort into masking the smell and visibility of environmental tobacco smoke.9	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	The third argument, and one with which it has had some success so far in the United Kingdom, is that the introduction of smoking bans in bars and restaurants will reduce takings, and thus sales tax and employment.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	To sustain this, it has engaged in a wide-ranging campaign directed at the hospitality industry.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	Yet, like its other arguments, this too is false.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	The most recent evidence is from New York where, in the 9 months after a ban on smoking in public places was introduced, sales tax receipts on food and drink increased by 12 per cent and employment in the hospitality industry increased.10 However, the most convincing evidence comes from a systematic review of research on the impact of bans on bar and restaurant revenue.11 The details results merit study.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	The authors examined 97 studies of the economic impact of smoking bans.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	Every one of the 37 studies finding a negative economic impact had been funded by the tobacco industry or written by consultants known to have industry links; these papers were 20 times as likely as those finding either no effect or an economic benefit to appear other than in a peer reviewed journal.	0
For example, the ‘Big Smoking Debate’ organized by the London Health Commission involving over 30 000 respondents indicated that the vast majority (76 per cent) wanted completely smoke free public places, including both smokers and non-smokers.2	In total, 94 per cent of the tobacco industry supportedstudies reported a negative economic impact.	0

This is because smoking not only incurs direct medical costs, but also indirect costs in terms of productivity losses.	Smokers may claim that the allure of lighting up provides motivation to work more efficiently, that nicotine as both a stimulant and relaxant boosts work performance, that smoking provides time for reflection, or that gatherings in smoking rooms generate not only gossip but also intellectual and productive discussions.	0

When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	From this realisation arises a difficult issue: how should the mainstream medical authorities approach the anti-vaccination movement?	0
When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	A passive reaction could be construed as endangering the health of society, whereas a heavy-handed approach can threaten the values of individual liberty and freedom of expression that we cherish [ref].	0
When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	An ethical dilemma emerges when health care providers attempt to persuade vaccine-hesitant families towards receiving vaccinations as this persuasion may lead to violating their autonomy [ref].	0
When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	Investigation of different types of vaccination policy finds strong evidence that standing orders and allowing healthcare workers without prescription authority (such as nurses) to administer vaccines in defined circumstances increases vaccination rates, and sufficient evidence that requiring vaccinations before attending child care and school also does so [ref].	0
When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	However, there is insufficient evidence to assess effectiveness of requiring vaccinations as a condition for hospital and other healthcare jobs [ref].	0
When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	Many countries, including Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States have specific requirements for reporting vaccine-related adverse effects, while other countries including Australia, France, and the United Kingdom include vaccines under their general requirements for reporting injuries associated with medical treatments [ref].	0

When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	Compulsory vaccination policies have been controversial as long as they have existed, with opponents of mandatory vaccinations arguing that governments should not infringe on an individual's freedom to make medical decisions for themselves or their children, while proponents of compulsory vaccination cite the well-documented public health benefits of vaccination [ref].	0
When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	Others argue that, for compulsory vaccination to effectively prevent disease, there must be not only available vaccines and a population willing to immunize, but also sufficient ability to decline vaccination on grounds of personal belief [ref].	0
When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	Vaccination policy involves complicated ethical issues, as unvaccinated individuals are more likely to contract and spread disease to people with weaker immune systems, such as young children and the elderly, and to other individuals in whom the vaccine has not been effective.	0
When parents won’t protect them, governments must [ref].	However, mandatory vaccination policies raise ethical issues regarding parental rights and informed consent [ref].	0

Horton noted, “All the indications are that the fourth Millennium Development Goal of reducing by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate will not be met in many countries.” No sub-Saharan country in Africa, he said, appears to be “on target to reach that MDG.”	1

Horton’s concern that “the next executive director of UNICEF is likely to be an American, irrespective of the person’s skills or experience” is understandable given how ill-equipped Bellamy was for the job.	0

The fear, apparently, was psychological — it was believed this might cause “irreparable harm” to the marriage and to the child.	“There’s no doubt that it’s easier to recruit a potential sperm donor if you tell him he can be anonymous,” said Fredrik Andreasson, a top executive at Seattle Sperm Bank, which has revised its own contracts.	0

The fear, apparently, was psychological — it was believed this might cause “irreparable harm” to the marriage and to the child.	Eggs harvested from women are typically done in a more open manner, with recipients given identifying information about the donors from the outset, or when the child turns 18.	0
The fear, apparently, was psychological — it was believed this might cause “irreparable harm” to the marriage and to the child.	The concept of anonymity has been hammered into the model of sperm donation since its inception.	0
The fear, apparently, was psychological — it was believed this might cause “irreparable harm” to the marriage and to the child.	The first recorded instance of artificial insemination with donor sperm occurred in 1884; the woman was never even told that another man’s semen was used.	1

Infertility carried a stigma for many years, and still does today, particularly among men — even though they contribute to about half of the infertility cases in the world.	0
The fear, apparently, was psychological — it was believed this might cause “irreparable harm” to the marriage and to the child.	As a result, sperm donation was shrouded in secrecy, even looked upon with shame, for nearly a century.	0

The demographic makeup of sperm bank customers has also become more diverse, including single women and lesbian couples who have encouraged more open conversations with children about their conception.	0
The fear, apparently, was psychological — it was believed this might cause “irreparable harm” to the marriage and to the child.	“I think with the increased visibility and acceptance of different kinds of families, the demographic that uses donor sperm has changed as well,” said Robin Baird, chief legal counsel at Columbus, Ohio-based sperm bank Cryobio.	0

The fear, apparently, was psychological — it was believed this might cause “irreparable harm” to the marriage and to the child.	Researchers find it difficult to track how many men have donated semen, how many children have resulted from each individual’s donation, and how much money is spent on procuring and purveying sperm.	0
