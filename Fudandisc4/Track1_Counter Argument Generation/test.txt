Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	while i completely agree with /u/settrah, i am going to take a different approach.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	if you still feel that way, then you should probably learn more.
Men's primary concern: Romantic Love.	men, however  do  have romantic love as their primary concern.	i have never had the idea that women were looking for safety and security over romantic love.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	why should they abstain from it when they want to ? protection can be used, but honestly, no form of protection is  effective.
Criticism of the free market and Luxottica's business practices.	that is not how the free market should work.	with a choice.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	what you just described is more akin to paying homage to a king or group of elites.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	rats can be trained to detect tb and landmines.
Discipline of children and spanking as a form of punishment.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	many children are incredibly young less than  when they start getting spanked.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	meth is almost as addictive as tobbaco, and will probably ruin your life too, but at least it feels nice.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	we are not telling christians or muslims what their beliefs are, and i think that in turn, believers should also allow atheists  the same courtesy  and not try to tell them what their beliefs are supposed to be.
Philosophy and Science's Relationship.	many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.	because knowledge is so vast that humans just do not have the life span or mental capacity to study every single subject ever.
Russian aggression towards Ukraine.	the government of the united states and ukraine have both denounced russia is actions as against  international law .	after wwii everyone realized the threat one country can pose which violates the universal truce among all nations without due cause.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	i believe it to be wrong.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	in these situations i find it is helpful to look at the person is achievements in life.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	the only  necessary  part of atheism is the absence of a positive belief in god s.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	the economic status of one place has always affected those around it, and the effects of globalization have only made it so that the effect of the economy in one place only has a greater affect in others.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	if you were gay, you would have an attraction to the same sex, but would grow up thinking it is bad and trying to force yourself to like the opposite sex.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	you manage to get  newspapers out on your average day.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	it is less obvious that they are more competitive, but i think a case can be made.
Software failures in vehicles.	why the point as software failures, malfunctions or whatever would mean you ca not go anywhere.	maybe we do not  need  it, but it will certainly benefit society.
Gender Quality in Two Nations.	let is say nation a has men who have more superior qualities mentioned above than nation b, but fewer women of high quality.	the men of b and the women of a are the losers in this scenario because they do not deserve to mate with their own group.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	crying is seen as a feminine action, and misogynists tend to dislike femininity; i am skeptical of your claim.
Cohl's peace after killing Childress and his role in religion.	however, after cohl and hart kill childress cohl seems truly at peace, even though he has not gotten the full truth or come anywhere near getting justice for the victims.	he was the keeper of carcosa, and seemed to me to be a central figure in the religion, just not the conspiracy.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	there are a lot of people who care about soccer in the us, and that number is growing; soccer gets coverage on espn, world cup makes major headlines, etc.
Complexity of Evolution vs Creationism.	complex topics like evolution and celestial mechanics would require thousands of years of discovery to even begin to comprehend.	evolution has been artificially overlaid over science, you could eliminate it altogether and have no less understanding of biology or physics.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	so, there really is not that much difference between a heterosexual relationship and a homosexual relationship.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	knives and cars have other uses despite being deadly; guns do not.
Future MMORPG games and their immersive experience.	most of mmorpg games thats coming in future will be much better then what i have played before.	they will be so immersive that the reality world will feel so bland.
The impact of public figures on society's perspective.	i do not understand being offended by one person is opinion.	what you desire is wide spread apathy.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	the world has grown but the two are still intrinsically linked.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	that is the job of philosophy, of definitions and concepts.
Male understanding of female experience and desire for it.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	the problem with this is that you are arguing that something does not exist just because you have not experienced it.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	so you are saying that you would not voluntarily give away money if you did not agree with how that money was being spent ? i do not agree with every single thing when it comes to how government revenues are spent.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	i praise your interest towards world news; but not doing the same with your own country is very irresponsible behaviour.
Low-skill labor and its societal impact.	my new employee is doing work that nearly anyone could do.	the social benefits of this increase far outweigh the cost to businesses.
Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	for most people that means they do not leave their local area because it is easier to interview for a job when you can easily get to the interview spot.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	when our genetic fate is determined by money, then money determines your attractiveness, health, and ability.
Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	also, this URL might also be worth reading, trans people actually have different brain structures compared to cis people.
Freedom of speech and the use of the word "oriental"	now i was just wondering why we ca not say the word oriental.	because the word is associated with outdated racist views and they the people you are referring to do not want to be referred to in that way.
Evaluation of Robert's Leadership Qualities.	and suffers from massive reality distortion field which gets him into fights he cannot win.	stannis was doing what was best for the realm by removing him.
Male understanding of female experience and desire for it.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	just because you do not know what it feels like to feel like you belong to a different gender does not mean that it does not exist, and that other people do not know what it feels like.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	you could argue that a tie does not provide a definitive conclusion, but after a penalty shootout in soccer there is a clear  winner  and clear  loser.
Hunting and its impact on wildlife conservation.	hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence.	market hunting is currently illegal in the us and will likely be so for the foreseeable future.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	is that not to be expected given our progressive tax system ? if you are paying more than the median income in taxes then you are earning  far  more than the median income.
Smoking and societal attitudes towards it.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	independent from these points, it smells fucking awful, literally cakes every surface in your home with soot and yellowed nicotine crap, and interrupts your life for you to get your nicotine fix.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	i recommend checking out websites with definitions by actual atheists, to know what it is that atheists really believe, e.
Gotham City's Crime and Corruption.	the city is plagued by psychotic villains who steal and kill constantly, who seem to manipulate or break their way out of prison with fearful ease.	i think it has something to do the endless and the abnegation by destruction of his duties.
Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	methinks calling him  mad  is a bit of an overreach.
Federal government's control and protection.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	and nor should they be.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	the munich conference, chopping up czechoslovakia and putting it on a platter for hitler was the worst diplomatic blunder leading to war.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	his vice president, george h.
Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	the start of fuel cell technology.
Capitalism and its limitations.	for another, competition becomes impractical after a point; try starting an isp, or a car company, or a petrochemical company.	see where this is headed ? do you believe that this is something that this is a mechanism which is the purpose of capitalism, or something that just ends up happening ? is it possible that this happens because capitalism is  not  unchecked ? there are many laws that are anti capitalist in nature, which allow the powerful and wealthy to consolidate more power and wealth.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	basically no life on earth is adapted to such hot climate.
Gender identity and transition options.	i feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the  i feel like i should have been male/female  argument.	you go to work/school/college and everyone calls you by a female name, again, you feel like this is not right, but who are you to argue, they are clearly addressing a woman.
Withdrawal from Cannabis Classification on Website	while withdrawal from cannabis has absolutely no drawbacks.	now, do not get me wrong, the federal government classifying marijuana as a schedule i drug is complete bullshit, but that is common knowledge.
Patriarchy in Western Society	patriarchy is a simple term describing a society in which fathers are the heads of families, men are the heads of tribes and governments, etc; descent is traced through the male line; and so forth.	therefore, there is a patriarchy.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	the length of my stay has allowed me to remove myself from american social culture enough to take a step back and view it with a less personal and move objective point of view.
Withdrawal from Cannabis Classification on Website	while withdrawal from cannabis has absolutely no drawbacks.	can you show me where on this site it classifies them as the same category as cocaine and heroin ? i ca not find it.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	knives and cars have other uses despite being deadly; guns do not.
Benefits of Vaccinations Outweigh Risks	the evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.	to use anti vaccination as a reason for involuntary commitment would set a dangerous precedent possibly leading to doctors being able to commit anyone who rejected a medical procedure.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	star city, central city, they all have their plagues.
Purpose of affirmative action in college admissions.	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	who is historically disadvantaged ? racial minorities like hispanic and black people.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	so because you choose to benefit from others in society, you agree that you should abide by the rules that they come up with, including the taxes you should pay.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	this is why it is the default position.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	forcibly.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	the  shareholders  side of it typically means grandma and grandpa is investment fund.
Trend of best-selling Wii games for casual players.	if you analyze the list of best selling games on the wii including wii sports, mario kart wii, wii sports resort, new super mario bros.	nintendo mostly loses out on the hardcore gamers because they are a casual console.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	probably because almost everyone who starts smoking ends up regretting it really badly later in life.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	you also have a lot more control over how you wanna make your pancake.
Morality and Personal Associations.	that does not make a person a shitty human being.	your idea of evil is a very short term strategy and i am in it for the long game.
Proper use of chopsticks for eating delicate food.	you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	when preparing foods, especially things like chicken and steak, chopsticks, again, are vastly superior to any form of skewering method as well as tongs because they are much more precise and do not damage the food.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	a good amount of the dod budget is spent on r d which both stimulates the economy and the technological level of the nation the internet started as a darpa research project.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	religions are often very contradictory.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	i am not sure what any of this has to do with the question of whether not paying taxes is immoral or not.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	you are wrong on many levels and many ways, and my original reply was simply in excess of the word length.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	they shut themselves off needlessly from each other as if art ca not exist in a world of science, and science has no place in a world of art.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	let is say your worst fear is true: that when you die there is nothing.
Morality and cheating.	i am arguing that there is no pragmatic reason why you should not cheat.	it is pretty terrible if you are willing to wake up next to her everyday knowing full well you have a relationship ending secret in your head.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	allowing nudity on tv would not help at all here, since tv has the same requirements as porn.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	they are not that hard.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	you might do stupid stuff like get off the subway early just so you can have a cig because you ca not stand it.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	more in self replies.
Federal government's control and protection.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	the government is not necessarily defined by your terms.
Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	? then there is the matter of finding work.
Morality and Personal Associations.	that does not make a person a shitty human being.	they are a shitty person by my standards.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	government, the largest monopoly of all, and a coercive one at that, to take over ? there are parts of the government that are bad, and parts that are good.
The deception of Santa Claus.	there is a real feeling that you have been lied to, because well you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.	do you even remember the feeling you had when you found your presents ? holy shit it was the best day of the year for me, nothing compared.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	it is now since private industries are trying to capture it, the public is reacting with a sense of distaste and aversion to it.
Criticism of Libertarianism and Government Monopolies.	i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.	democrats and republicans are the ones with illegitimate, emotional viewpoints, as they base everything on  should be  rather than  what is.
Marriage as a Reflection of Christ and the Church	i also subscribe to the notion that marriage is meant to be a reflection on christ and the church, that is, a bridegroom christ and a bride the church .	it is true that the new testament uses heterosexual marriage as a metaphor for christ is relationship with the church, but then so what ? god is completely beyond human comprehension, so we are forced to use a rich variety of metaphors and poetic language to describe  him.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	now our children are locked up by the companies that produce them.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	he tries to be objectively just, and is stubborn in the pursuit of it.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	if you believe in a completely material world, then any perfect simulation is indistinguishable from a  real  world, because all rules would be reconstructed exactly, and all interactions and emergence of complexity from those rules would be replicated perfectly as well.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	it was now a personal blood feud.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	i am not sure what any of this has to do with the question of whether not paying taxes is immoral or not.
Theoretical limits of modeling particles in the universe.	theoretically speaking, if methuselah lived long enough and had enough clay tablets he could perform all of the calculations necessary to model all of the particles in the universe.	it is a leap of intuition that i am unable to make to consider that my consciousness exists because of a massive store of clay tablets.
Federal government's control over constitution.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	most people who move to a different area do so because they found a good job that suits them there.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	there is only so much we can do, and while dying out is not very likely, life could be miserable.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	there are many scenarios when risk taking is sensible, like making an investment with a potentially massive payoff.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	now, if we are going to measure something as gauzy as  superiority,  we are going to have to get arbitrary, of course, but the main issue is the metrics are chosen by men/a man and thus are inherently more likely to support the concept of male superiority.
Federal government's control over constitution.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	the preamble says that the federal government was formed to  in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  URL as such, the federal government has the power to address all of those issues.
Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	if there is a charity dedicated to helping the american mentally ill, should they instead focus on starving african children because their need is greater ? if you want to donate some money to the british heart foundation because heart problems run in your family, would you appreciate someone coming up to you and telling you to target less fortunate countries instead and stop being selfish by donating to a first world charity ? people have a right to campaign for whatever issues they so please, provided they are not doing it by attacking others  issues.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	individuals who are rich today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	tywin lannister what made the red wedding tactically brilliant but strategically foolish was the blatancy of the betrayal, violation of guest right, and murder of countless other northern and riverlander nobles.
Misconceptions about the LGBTQ+ community.	or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	you clearly have a fundamental misunderstanding about gay people, i hope you find some more information about the subject and get educated.
The effects of restricted nudity and internet pornography.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	speaking of all or nothing, revealing swimwear is very common in advertisement, and few people get upset about that.
Advancement in the Workplace Based on Obedience Rather Than Intelligence.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	how does rewarding obedience equate to rewarding stupidity ? so the best way to play the game is to be stupid ? not if they wanted to get ahead, apparently.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	native american culture survives to this day, children learn about in school, they observe native american heritage month in november, many states/counties/cities are proud of their connection to native peoples.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	this is data abstracted, it has no mechanism by which to act.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	religion has been one of the primary driving forces behind societies for most of human history.
Importance of Proper Communication in Job Interviews	i am pretty sure i could not have even gotten an interview if i spoke like lil  montrell up the street haha.	when most people think black culture, they are actually thinking about prison or street culture.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	gnostic atheism is making a specific claim that no god exists.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	okay smart guy.
Health risks associated with soft drink consumption.	caffeine is an addictive substance, and the high fructose corn syrup that is so common in soft drinks can contribute to many long term health problems including tooth decay, obesity, heart disease, liver failure, and diabetes.	prolonged exposure to solid dhmo causes severe tissue damage.
Using chopsticks.	if you do pick something up with them, you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	while disposable utensils are usually made of plastic, which is probably much worse for the environment.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	when i attempted to kill myself, i just wanted to get away from all of my problems.
Chopstick etiquette and soup slurping.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	they make take some practice to use, but they are far from impractical.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	very few things can compare to being loved, and a  college degree  is not one of them although it is very important.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	under no circumstances can they be approved.
The dangers of smoking and developing addiction.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	there is very little wrong with what you are doing, but it is not innocuous.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	there is nothing wrong with question your own position if new information becomes available.
Personal stance on controlled substance use.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	those who have certain experiences while on drugs would still want to have them sober, and would still enjoy them sober.
Discussion about a losing war and betrayal of a leader.	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	it was not just robb; thousands of common soldiers and multiple tullys, manderlys, mormons, flints, blackwoods, and so on were slaughtered while under the protection of the freys at the orders of the lannisters/iron throne.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	baby boomers almost crippled our economy i am aware of the generalization here, just bear with me  because  they did not question the policies of these men.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	he had it.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	they are not pulled from the void, people get inspired by things they read.
Proof of God's existence through logic.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	that is only evidence about how the human brain is wired.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	you not paying the taxes you agreed to pay is theft.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	the preamble says that the federal government was formed to  in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  URL as such, the federal government has the power to address all of those issues.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	if the boy king had been the solitary victim of a poisoned chalice or crossbow bolt to the eye, it might have actually come as a relief some of the northerners and riverlanders.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	and who is to say that they would complete a  more lucrative degree  ? for example, most lucrative degrees certain sciences, engineering, finance, etc.
Same-sex marriages in a life simulation game.	there is a work around that allows same sex marriages, which is to make a male character a female or vise versa.	this is either an argument to have no romance at all in the game, or both same and opposite sex relationships.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	so you are saying that you would not voluntarily give away money if you did not agree with how that money was being spent ? i do not agree with every single thing when it comes to how government revenues are spent.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	if they had stolen cars and crashed into someone, it would still be a tragedy that their lives were disrupted, but society at large would say they got what they deserved.
Negative effects of corporal punishment.	spanking has also been linked to drug abuse, criminal behavior, and mental/emotional issues.	all you are really saying is that poorly behaved kids do not respond to discipline.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	i think it is much easier and more common to leave cat outside rather than dogs.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	can drugs be a filter for experiences ? sure, but they can also provide a more heightened, intensified, and involved experience that being sober cannot provide.
Personal stance on controlled substance use.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	i have nothing against other drugs, but i personally have not had enough interest to try them.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	it is very nuanced, of course, which is why it is contentious, and catchy taglines like  teach boys not to rape  are going to get some spotlight.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	well almost everything breaks down at some point when you go to the extremes.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	knowing your own limits and abilities allows you to act with confidence, be it by solving a problem, or seeking additional information.
Comparison of science and religion in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	for example, european scholars for much of european history from the middle ages onward believed that understanding the natural world was a key step in understanding god, that a rational god made a rational world that could be rationally described.
Debate on the role of evidence in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	no, a true god would see this as us suspending our gifts and deluding ourselves.
Views on Hierarchy and Equality in Society	i like hierarchy, and find leadership and social status motivating.	if you care only about how far you can climb the ladder, then you are nothing more than a sociopath.
Perceptions and Risks of Casual Sex.	casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	is skiing a gate way to heroin use ?.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	your example uses nutella, which i could not even imagine using, with it already being harder to spread.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	those who think they  can  and those who think they  ca not , are both usually right.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	appeasement never would have worked, and you are blaming western leaders for trying to stop a belligerent tyrant in europe.
Clarifying the distinction between hard and soft atheism.	atheists often dispute that these are separate categories, speaking of hard and soft atheism.	this is incorrect.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	modern taxation in the us if far from a group of people collecting money for their own personal gain.
Paternity leave and feminism in the labor market.	paternity leave increase in the cost of labor market rigidity unemployment.	paid paternity leave and men actually taking it is a  feminist  issue.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	russel is tea pot is a thought experiment to elucidate why burden of proof is on the one making a claim, and that rejection of a claim is not by necessity a claim itself.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	this depends on the temperament of the cat, and while many cats may lash out, at least they probably wo not kill the person when they do.
Impact of British Empire on Third World and Hitler's Expansion Plans.	but the british empire was the largest and the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	do you truly think that a creeping fascist state and a creeping communist state could have coexisted ? especially when both wanted the land in between them and the animosity between the two was widely known ? all in all it is pretty outrageous that you blame great britain for the war and apparently for causing the escalation of the holocaust ? ! when they were not the aggressor and when it is pretty clear that the ussr and germany were on a collision course regardless of what happened in the west.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	sweden, nor any of the nordic countries, is the utopia you envision.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	it would be so hot you would die, with no low tech means to cool you down.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	i guess i am kind of the wrong person to argue for religious beliefs, but the dismiss popular belief in deities as people not thinking critically enough is basically just wrong.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	in some ways i believe it is the easier way out.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	he passed away at about  years of age, in part because of his complications with smoking.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	i write because i love to immerse myself and discover all the vivid and magical details of which this universe has to offer me.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	even mechanically applied knowledge is still knowledge we actually had an exercise in one of my education courses on this that comes to mind.
Opposing view on the biological basis of homosexuality.	i do not discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.	 therefore it is a choice to be gay.
Opposing view on the biological basis of homosexuality.	i do not discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.	so even if there is no  biological  basis for their being gay, they still have no choice in the matter.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	as someone who has attempted suicide in the past i agree to an extent and also disagree to an extent.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	you must have missed the recent ruling in the eu regarding the right to vanish.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	there is nothing wrong with question your own position if new information becomes available.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	if god did exist, he would be natural by definition.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	renly was like robert, and robert was a bad king.
Judgment towards drug preferences.	nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring lsd or mdma.	legalizing drugs would still be a part of the war on drugs because it would necessitate a hostile takeover of drug cartels and manufacturers.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	i think you kind of have a dangerous mentality  its their conscious decision to make so i am not to blame  but you are also making the conscious decision to aid in the ruining of someone is life.
Atheism as Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	this is nonsense, and no different that saying climate change denial is the default position.
Suicide and its reasons.	suicide is almost always tragic, misguided and ultimately futile.	this seems to me to be a confirmation that you believe there is no way to commit suicide that is not  amisguided.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	we will get into this later.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	rather than equality as a goal, i think that ought to be our societal objective, as well as providing opportunities for advancement.
Risks and Rewards of Teenage Sex.	however, i feel like the risks of sex as a teenager far outweigh the rewards.	this does not at weight to the argument that sex ed is bad.
The Definition of Atheism and Belief in Mythological Gods	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	i feel very confident that you are an atheist in regards to asd f, at least, and probably several other gods, either in fiction, myth, or other.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	with theft, if you have recorded the serial numbers of your stuff, and stuff with those serial numbers is in someone else is possession, you might have a clear cut case, though of course the other side can claim that the stuff was borrowed or bought.
Alternative treatments for gender dysphoria.	fix your dysphoria without going through a potentially disastrous and expensive series of surgeries etc.	i am not sure how effective these cures would be.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	you would think i would be obese from how often i spend sitting and how sparsely i exercise, but nope, i am practically a rail.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	you can probably cross  record sales  off that list.
Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	this is an attempt to redefine terms, and is non standard.
Human adaptability and survival.	humans will simply adapt and move on, we are an incredibly resourceful species and have collectively survived or overcome every single challenge posed to us.	yes but both can sure as hell kill us all.
Atheism and the Afterlife	i believe there is no god, no heaven and no hell.	if this is as true as we believe it to be, then suffering is an unbearable moral burden and we must act to correct it in any way we can.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	no one gets rewarded for being stupid.
Comparison of regular birth control pills and Plan B.	why should regular daily pill birth control be any different ?	blood clot in the heart heart attack.
Debate on the morality of homosexuality.	that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	to be honest, i am not all too familiar with catholic doctrine.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	let is assume hitler did not want war with the west.
Criticism of rural group's barbaric behavior.	by comparison, her whole group proceeded to fight and scream at each other throughout the whole night, completely fail at mounting an effective defense or escape, and ended up killing each other/getting eaten until she was the only one left.	so yes, they maintain a positive attitude, but is it possible that they can have this  generally positive  attitude because they did not see the horrors that other people saw ? at least to the same extent ? again, it could just be the circumstances.
Affirmative Action Policy	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	would you support preferential treatment of poorer applicants, or do you think it should be only about their qualification ? if you do support it, how would you propose to measure a person is wealth ?.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	no singular religion is ubiquitous, and the tenants of some religions are in conflict.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	it shows confidence can be used as a tool when required, if you have better information you can often get superior results.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	arguments like instinct do not go anywhere with society nowadays.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	yes, i know how to use chop sticks properly.
Advantages of Neutral and Fixed Money.	in particular, i see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.	national currencies are backed by the country that uses it.
Dangers of texting while driving.	texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	how ? i do not see a correlation.
Federal government's power and control over minimum wage.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	why do we give them that power ? going from what you said above: minimum wage ? arguments of effectiveness aside, i would say it fits squarely in the ability to pursue happiness.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	most people end up living wherever they find a job.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	i would not say never, but i would imagine it is so rare as to be non consequential.
The rationality of believing in God.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	what if the criticism is that you can never prove nor disprove the claim  god exists  and that it would be therefore irrational to believe in such a claim ? we do not know if it is our mind playing tricks, if it is aliens toying with us, if we are just being stupid, if it is xyz or if it is actually  god.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	so think about the monopoly of force you would be giving this government who has been engaging in global espionage and the system which has, over the last  years, been quietly and slowly taking away freedoms via the patriot act and aforementioned prism.
Atheism and the Afterlife	i believe there is no god, no heaven and no hell.	there is no afterlife, as far as i am concerned.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	life could adapt if it took a hundred thousand years, but not in a century.
The path to finding God through trust/faith versus enlightenment.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	do not religious text say that the path to god, is through trust, not enlightenment ? if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ? basically.
Obesity and Bad Decision Making.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	i agree, but the difference is that in the case of obesity, many times the decision being made is being made by the parents of the obese party, not the obese party themselves.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	this is exactly what we are telling children when we tell them to follow their dreams.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	you should reword that, if that was not the intended message.
Transgender struggle and its comparison to other minority struggles.	i do not think the trans struggle is on the same level as that of homosexuals and racial minorities.	there are some who never undergo hormone replacement therapy.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	if this is true, then being sober is no different.
Opinions on Donald Trump's wife, Melania.	but more importantly she does not appear like gold digger, she feels she earned everything with work.	whenever she talks about donald talks about him very highly, even when she has the opportunity to betray him.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	really cares.
Criminal disenfranchisement and empathy-based morality in voting rights.	if we can agree that laws are based on commonly accepted standards of morality and that morality is based on empathy, then people who have proven their lack of empathy through their own criminality should  almost by definition  not be given the right to vote.	because they are people who are affected by policy changes.
Limitations of Poetry in Subject Matter	i feel poetry fails to combine these two elements diversely, and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	i do agree that simply memorizing poetry does not seem to have much of a benefit that i am aware of, but analyzing, reading, and writing poetry are important to understand aspects of world culture in contexts that are much more lyrical and sometimes more challenging than basic literary or visual contexts.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	this is a flawed analogy.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	two mothers could not have nearly that kind of impact on me.
Hunting and its impact on wildlife conservation.	hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence.	most experts in wildlife management consider hunting to be one of the most useful tools for managing a species at a population level.
Misinterpretation of the phrase "I do not care"	even here, i would argue that the narrator does actually care about the consequences of her actions just not the consequences that most people would be thinking about when their car is totaled.	the trouble here is that the key phrase is ambiguous:  i do not care  can mean  i do not care about anything at all,  but that is not necessarily or even usually what is meant by it.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	also, i am a bit uncomfortable with the argument that sexually unsuccessful males could become dangerous.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	what is the point of going to a church if it is not a community that can help you when you need it ? death is hard to deal with.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	why would they have built the german equivalent of the maginot line the westwall if he intended to invade westward ? hitler did not want a war with britain, france, or the usa.
Negotiating car purchase with cash upfront.	cash up front gives me leverage to negotiate a better price on the purchase.	as i understand it, financing brings in money for the dealership, so if you do not do car financing, you are not as profitable to the dealership.
Collective action and political influence for social change.	the people can collectively rise up and overthrow those with unjust power.	and sometimes, this is caused because of certain economies of scales or legal obstacles to enter the market.
Opinions on tattoos as a superficial trend.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	i do not think tattoos need to have a deep meaning to be legitimate, and i do not have any empirical data that proves that one mindset is more prevalent than the other, so i ca not say if  meaningless  tattoos are actually the majority.
Trade with countries lacking freedom, justice, and equality.	why should developed countries trade with countries which have a lack of freedom, justice, and equality ?	until you posted the comment above.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	simple statistics, meeting the right person for me was not working by going out, and as a working professional who put in a lot of hours, i did not have enough time for a large enough sample size.
Clarifying the distinction between hard and soft atheism.	atheists often dispute that these are separate categories, speaking of hard and soft atheism.	atheism and agnosticism are not different sides of the same coin, they are different coins being flipped for different questions.
Challenges of using chopsticks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	plus, if someone is slurping from a spoon, they are going to be slurping for much longer than if they were drinking straight out of the bowl.
Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	if american women are more interested in the rights of american women, so what ? same with men, race, sexuality there is nothing wrong with being interested in issues which concern you directly and it is pretty much part of human nature to do so.
The deception of Santa Claus.	there is a real feeling that you have been lied to, because well you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.	you would wait for weeks for that morning.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	that is not an argument against the concept of casual sex, that is just an argument against people doing it poorly.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	disbelieving URL in turn, does not entail claiming the opposite that no gods exist.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	do you also support performance enhancing drugs ? which will be lost among the sea of other tall people.
Debate on the morality of homosexuality.	that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	i do not follow the logic behind this at all.
Opinions on Acting Skill and Roleplaying.	i find bad acting very cringey, and i do not act well so trying out roleplaying/watching other people act badly does not appeal to me.	the level of acting varies widely by group, and by individual.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	where i grew up you get your learners license at the age of  and that allowed me and many others years of practicing driving under parental supervision before even graduating high school.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	so claiming that the government only  helped  but was not responsible for the creation of the internet is just plain false.
Risk and uncertainty in life-saving decisions.	so gambling with a person a life without even guaranteeing the safety of others, is even less desirable.	you are right, there is no guarantee that the surgery would work but there is also no guarantee that joel could keep ellie safe.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	there is tons of evidence that supports all thoughts, emotions, and awareness exists as processes in the brain.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	this would be economic growth the people will be better off but it does not increase their nominal incomes or  create jobs.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	what you need to understand about ideas and media in general is they just are not for your consumption but you can  also use them.
Clarifying the distinction between hard and soft atheism.	atheists often dispute that these are separate categories, speaking of hard and soft atheism.	it is just a definition that seems to have been written by a theist with a chip on their shoulder.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	since bitcoin currently lets you do all kinds of different things financially as discussed above.
Patriarchy in Western Society	patriarchy is a simple term describing a society in which fathers are the heads of families, men are the heads of tribes and governments, etc; descent is traced through the male line; and so forth.	you, yourself, are not arguing a strawman.
Relationship between religion and science.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.	good and evil are subjective and relative to the perspective of the person making the labels.
Gender stereotypes in media portrayal of romantic relationships.	women are often portrayed in the media as being very concerned about romantic love and men as commitment phobes more interested in sex.	i have never had the idea that women were looking for safety and security over romantic love.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	cut down more trees, and further changes.
Human adaptability and survival.	humans will simply adapt and move on, we are an incredibly resourceful species and have collectively survived or overcome every single challenge posed to us.	there is no reason to panic over animal extinctions, there is no tangible benefit to preserving animal species.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	or being better at getting an education is most important.
Job satisfaction and career aspirations.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	a job is just that, a job.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	experiments like the milgram experiment URL and the standford prison experiment URL show that people will follow orders that go against their moral conscious if they come from a figure of authority.
Zero tolerance policy in schools	i also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who ca not solve problems on their own.	it is that simple.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	a job is just that, a job.
Proof of God's existence through logic.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	but we have astounding evidence, so staying in the default position is not reasonable.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	but he is driven clinically insane by the injustices he is subjected to.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	there are lists of lists of people/cultures URL that not longer exist for one reason or another.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	the concept that this could not also give rise to consciousness is simply an assertion without any particular reason to believe it.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	it is the same drive that makes so many of us fork over cash for a slim chance at winning the lottery, make often shoddy investment decisions in the stock market and chase get rich quick scams that almost always make us worse off than before.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	you should not have to love it or even like it.
Renly's chances of having children.	and renly does not have terribly great chances of having children.	he had it.
The path to finding God through trust/faith versus enlightenment.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	the book says to take it is word for it, so why do not you ?   because we never just  take anyone is word for it.
Criticism of Libertarianism and Government Monopolies.	i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.	government has no reason to be best/efficient/customer friendly, because they can make themselves the monopoly in a service and cut out all competition.
The importance of narratives in games.	narratives are incredibly important to good games.	? many of the most successful games in history have no narrative.
Fear of death and afterlife beliefs.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	you have no reason to believe this is what happens after death.
The nature of evidence and how it relates to God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	do not religious text say that the path to god, is through trust, not enlightenment ? if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ? to be clear, you are suggesting blind trust, not just regular everyday trust, correct ? let is ensure we are not equivocating by talking about trust and how we define it.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	every place where you ca not smoke becomes a marathon to get out and have your fix.
Character description.	instead he chose the way of evil magic and became a kinslayer.	he then suffered an unfortunate and improbable defeat, but he rallied plenty of people regardless.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	justice would be better served if we learned to treat rape just like other crimes look at the available evidence, and make a sensible decision, without calling the character of the victim into question in ways that are not relevant to the case.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	the amount of damage a cat can do if it is scared and attacks a person or child is far less than even a rather small dog.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	or the harry potter fangirls who think england is all tea, rain, and a posh accent.
Debate on the importance of animal species conservation.	i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	as far as humans lives are concerned, i do not think it is essential that seven billion people live on the earth.
***Possible topic: The threat of infectious diseases.	we are overdue for a severe plague.	also, is it that much of a problem ? to some extent, in order to have extreme wealth inequality one needs advanced technology and prosperous societies.
Chopstick etiquette and soup slurping.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	while i do not want to be horribly ethnocentric, and i know etiquette is a cultural construct, i find that practice to be absolutely revolting.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	you do not even get high.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	they are not impractical if you cut the meal before serving it.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	that being said, there is nothing inherently better about having certain experiences sober, so if one can provide a certain context for some experiences by getting high, then what exactly is the problem ? it is arguable that by being sober all the time and refusing the possibility of ever doing recreational drugs, one is living life on the default settings and is refusing to expand and push the boundaries of their experience.
Clarifying the distinction between hard and soft atheism.	atheists often dispute that these are separate categories, speaking of hard and soft atheism.	its a bad definition, which is why many people reject it.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	i may have still dated them, but i could have found out sooner and wasted less time.
Controversy over offensive sports team names.	while i understand why a team name like  redskins  is a bigoted name, i do not understand why people get offended over something so inconsequential.	i can understand why that person would be feeling that way without myself experiencing the same pain in the face from being punched by me.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	understand the nature of this fear as possibly being a test of your character.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	i for, example, absolutely not attracted by boys of my age, but love strong and mature grown up guys.
Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	if she wants to compete for fide world championship, she can.
Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	i could make arguments that we should refer to the mentally disabled as  tards  because that is only one syllable, and quick speech is important.
Patriarchy in Western Society	patriarchy is a simple term describing a society in which fathers are the heads of families, men are the heads of tribes and governments, etc; descent is traced through the male line; and so forth.	clearly western society is a traditionally patriarchal one.
Argument for legalizing all crimes to save money.	why not make all crimes legal, then the police do not need to exist and we save all the money !	it is not legal to drive drunk, why ca not it also be illegal to drive high it already ? there are already people doing these drugs, so legality does not make it safer for others.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	that does not mean that everyone knows them.
Foreign aid and small business support in Africa.	i also feel more money should be spent on foreign aid, especially in the form of small business support in africa, for example.	how would you prevent the corporations from simply moving their operations over seas ? i am all in favor of getting people out of abject poverty.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	if i had to rate people on purely physical appearance, my bff is an  and her bf is a .
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	then you fail to grasp the reason for them.
Reading habits of Reddit users.	most reddit users skim comments at best and do not bother to read low enough or read down voted threads.	the rest of us do not make it down that far to downvote it.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	safety: a cat is generally a safer pet.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	it is also the same thing that allows us to dream of contributing tons of money and resources to those in need, start foundations to solve challenging problems, empower others who have dreams that might change the world, and, most importantly, gain confidence in knowing that our kids and grandkids hopefully wo not have to struggle as much when they become adults.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	therefore, instruments used for killing must be banned from the dining table, and that is why chinese food is always chopped into bite size before it reaches the table.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	how can you say it was evil ? we do not know yet enough about the lord of light to say if he is good or evil.
Racism and Stereotyping.	if you cross the street based purely on race that would be racist.	it is just probability.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	say you use netflix.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	then i assume you also have issues with the overtime structure for the regular season for the nhl and the nfl.
Personal stance on controlled substance use.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	why should there be an arbitrary line when it comes to certain types of recreational drug use ? you yourself consume caffeine for purely recreational purposes, despite that not being your primary objective, but you have not made any attempt to justify why caffeine is alright, but other drugs are not.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	the small folk do not care who the king is gods are.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	i never watched the sopranos, but i consider breaking bad to be one of the most overrated shows ever made.
The purpose of education.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	maybe it will work for you, maybe not, but avoid getting trapped into only being interested in what you were good at, otherwise when you are  you wo not be good at anything you were not good at when you were .
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	so, if you want to profit from the value the us dollar carries you are going to have to comply with the terms you and i have agreed upon.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	if people just wanted sexual pleasure they would not get married and have kids.
Same-sex marriages in a life simulation game.	there is a work around that allows same sex marriages, which is to make a male character a female or vise versa.	this element would be lost with the addition of same sex marriages small factor, but still.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	so what singles this out ?.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	and you yourself is the only person who should determine what is good enough for you.
Equality and Discrimination.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	the problem with different treatment is there is no way to know if it is warranted just by gender.

Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	other countries get to emerge victorious, and  nobody from the u.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	if you do not want someone socially reserved, check their profile and see what they like to do.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	of course, you are going to have ecosystems that have so radically changed in composition that they may not even remain sustainable.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	renissance style art is very good, the figures are realistic, shading is crazy, rich colors, etc but its all very bland.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	a system that oppresses minorities as a matter of rote, and where police are often on a power trip  even when a good majority of the populace is armed ; guns really do not cause crime.
Comparison of federal government services to companies and state institutions.	the federal government is better at services than any company or state institution can be.	nazism and stalinism were both extremely big government.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	changes that federal congress ca not make as easily because the country is still divided on some issues.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	though bush is policies are often cited as examples of boomer excess, nothing he did was really unique to his generation.
Criticism of a writer's skills and downvotes.	and for having a lot of discussion, what is up with the pile of downvotes ?	why do you compare it with writers ? the equivalent of a writer is a composer, not a musician.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	yes they cannot have children together.
Introverts' discomfort with extroverts' questioning.	i have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being  forced to talk  by being asked questions.	the particular situation will simply come up more with those who are more introverted, and introverts are less common in social situations primarily because they have less need of them.
The importance of science in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	i am roman catholic, and i know we do not do this.

Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	and poorly trained cats, but my cat has never  attacked us in play.
The limitations of deriving meaning from criminal behavior.	that being said, to try to derive anything exceptionally deep or meaningful about society from any of these things i do not think is particularly useful.	and the edge phenomena of genetic mutations tells us about genetics.
Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	they just want someone who will protect them.
Personal stance on controlled substance use.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	i probably will try psychedelics at some point, but now is not my time for that.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	is it possible that at that bar, a lot of people order manhattans without bitters ? i was asked if i wanted vermouth in a vodka martini at the classier bar once, because i asked the bartender about this a lot of people ask them to hold the vermouth there, or get mad when they add it without telling them.
Gender identity and expression.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	if someone transitions from male to female it is not that they felt like a guy and decided to try changing to a girl, they always felt like a girl.
Negative effects of technological conveniences.	the darker side is that technological conveniences are often less necessary.	rather than increasing what we can accomplish, reduce the amount of effort required at the cost of individuality, health, or the ability to function in a less pampering environment.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	while we ca not yet speak to the longevity of the idea, it is already far more than you are claiming.
The difficulty of winning the war against terrorism.	we could literally blow up every remaining terrorist, and we still would have lost the war.	it reminds me of a clip of a little boy watching a convoy passing, and in the middle of it, he bombs it and runs away.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	but when that is combined with the pop culture attitude where girls  pretend not to want it  and boys are the ones who have to get them to give it up, you have a bad recipe there.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	on a more negative note, you could argue that much of the entire  white man is guilt  genre of plots stems from white settlers  destruction of native american culture.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	is this wrong ? no.
Evaluation of Robert's Leadership Qualities.	and suffers from massive reality distortion field which gets him into fights he cannot win.	he barely survived one siege, but he won.
Discussion about a losing war and betrayal of a leader.	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	three heads of house stark rickard, brandon, and eddard had been killed at the orders of the iron throne in the last twenty years alone, with members of other northern and riverlander houses royce, mallister, etc executed alongside them as well.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	i tend to look at massive scale operations from a serious  how can i make profit off of this  perspective as i believe it is the safest assumption that can be made about people and groups with such a crushing responsibility to fulfill so many needs.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	firstly, native american food culture has an incredible influence on our own.
Tattoos and their significance.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	are you saying that you find pirates and indigenous people interesting because they are not what you see every day, so their tattoos must have more value ? or are you suggesting that their tattoos must inherently have had a reason for being made because of their lifestyles ? if that is the case, then are gang members teardrop tattoos  displaying valid forms of expression for you ? how are pirates any different from modern criminals, who are  often heavily tattooed.
Raising the driving age and preventing texting while driving.	i think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	my first illegal drug was nicotine at age .
Password Security and Formula Usage.	ideally, passwords should not be reused, and a formula should be used to generate unique passwords for each account you have.	it would narrow down the brute force keyspace by at least :, probably more.
Disadvantages of gas-powered vehicles.	crappy gas powered cars and trucks until the dinosaur juice runs out and/or the earth just flat out explodes, whichever comes first.	also, keep in mind that huge amounts of electricity comes from burning coal.
The impact of public figures on society's perspective.	i do not understand being offended by one person is opinion.	if it went completely unchallenged by atheists because they didnt want to act too easily offended the consequence is that statement starts to ring more true since no one challenged it.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	if they do not have this common sense, they really should not be trusted with spending money at all.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	but this does not mean that you ca not love both money, and be a good friend.
Purpose of affirmative action in college admissions.	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	however, the blanket label of race as a signal of need harms all students, regardless of color.
Views on Hierarchy and Equality in Society	i like hierarchy, and find leadership and social status motivating.	rather than equality as a goal, i think that ought to be our societal objective, as well as providing opportunities for advancement.
Negative effects of technological conveniences.	the darker side is that technological conveniences are often less necessary.	you have completely lost the ability to function in a technology free environment, as have i.
Chopsticks and their practicality.	but for practically everything else, there is just no god damn reason to use chopsticks when western utensils are more practical, and better for the environment.	source URL but the majority of these are made of bamboo which is a very renewable resource.
Purpose of affirmative action for disadvantaged students.	the intent behind the affirmative action is certainly well meaning, aimed at helping needy students.	however, the blanket label of race as a signal of need harms all students, regardless of color.
Anti-Semitic sentiment during wartime.	hostilities against the jews were more intense because of the war.	he did this knowing that france and great britain had promised poland protection.
Sharing personal experience as a universal truth.	projecting your experience to everybody is a logical mistake.	kids just have not developed the ability to think about consequences like they should e.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	understand that fear is normal, but that you cannot let it paralyze you.

Outrage culture and privilege.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	you were probably not bullied in school for being pale, black, muslim, or gay.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	my point is that genesis  does not say the world is , years old, even if it is taken literally.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	the munich conference, chopping up czechoslovakia and putting it on a platter for hitler was the worst diplomatic blunder leading to war.
Disagreeing with Webster's Dictionary and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.	disagreeing with webster is dictionary and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.	when in doubt i believe it is best to assume good faith, however even then engaging something which is just fractally wrong, or worse not even wrong, can become tiresome.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	it is not consistent in portrayal at all.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	in fact, the government attempted to sell off the research project to a bunch of private companies which all declined to buy it.
Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	many gay people do not know many trans people personally and do not understand their issues and their experiences.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	we also have a greater percentage of our population in the military in active combat that most european countries or at least the unshakeable perception that we do.
Philosophical Writing	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	i conclude now i have no  inner resources, because i am heavy bored.
Trend of best-selling Wii games for casual players.	if you analyze the list of best selling games on the wii including wii sports, mario kart wii, wii sports resort, new super mario bros.	wii and of course wiifit, you will see a trend: these are all games that were either created for casual players, or very casual entries in an existing series.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	that woman is husband, god forbid he finds out, will be devastated.
Bad decision making and quitting smoking.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	with eating it is also hard, perhaps not harder, but in any case  more complicated.
Gender Quality in Two Nations.	let is say nation a has men who have more superior qualities mentioned above than nation b, but fewer women of high quality.	in reality they can, but it would not be optimal.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	bullying in school can also happen with the parents being interracial, the parents not being a common religion, or being disabled.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	easy or not, hard or not, selfish or not, whatever or not.
Existence of phenomena and the role of an all-powerful God.	the existence of these phenomena would require an all powerful god to permit them.	how about god gave you reason, gave you choice, gave you freedom, and you decide what to do with it ? or i could conclude that god is so awesome, he gave us critical thinking and reason to do whatever we wanted, instead of just creating lemmings that follow the same pattern.
Faith and the nature of God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	this loop of faith is stable once initiated, but many people do not want to get into it.
Views on Hierarchy and Equality in Society	i like hierarchy, and find leadership and social status motivating.	i firmly believe that one should consider others as well as oneself.
Income inequality and its effects on society.	in the countries which have the least income inequality the scandinavian countries and japan crime and poverty are reduced, but birth rates are unusually low and depression is high.	and depression rates seem to be an easily explainable correlation.
The deception of Santa Claus.	there is a real feeling that you have been lied to, because well you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.	to kids who are still young enough they believe in santa ?.
Proof of God's existence through logic.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	i assume you are familiar with russell is teapot.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	what makes you think that you are right and they are wrong ? you have merely stated this opinion as fact  in addition, the fact that sexual activity can lead humans to form emotional bonds with each other can lead to dangerous consequences unhappiness and a lack of fulfillment if people sleep with others whose personalities they may not be able to accept.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	worst possible drug to be honest, it gives you nothing and takes everything.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	atheism itself just says the person does not believe in gods.

Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	i can think of a lot of things i could train someone to do reasonably well within an hour, that would arguably help them with their day to day functions if properly applied.
Smoking and societal attitudes towards it.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	find a lung cancer ward, or find people who had complications with smoking, you will see what sort of damage it can cause.
Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	i do not think i have ever seen any employees told an irate customer to go fuck themselves and gtfo the store while i have seen even managers get chewed up by dipshit customers and just taking it like a little bitch.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	it is a logical impossibility for the logical man to derive happiness at the expense of his integrity.
Alternative treatments for gender dysphoria.	fix your dysphoria without going through a potentially disastrous and expensive series of surgeries etc.	it would be like trying to turn a straight person gay.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	you are not born with knowledge of your specific religion, and you only get to that religion by hearing about it.
Negative effects of technological conveniences.	the darker side is that technological conveniences are often less necessary.	as far as  less pampered,  you are going to define your terms better and then estimate the odds of that environment occurring.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	this is all ignoring the primary purpose of the defense budget which is to protect the nation from invasion and protect our national interests abroad.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	these policy makers were not just the followers of reagen, they were not just republicans.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	spanking is not about retaliation or to engage a dialogue; it is to provide immediate conditioning against engaging in unacceptable behavior.

Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	if you care only about how far you can climb the ladder, then you are nothing more than a sociopath.
Chopstick etiquette and usage.	i do realize that chopsticks are more appropriate for a few select foods.	chinese people, under the cultivation of confucianism, consider the knife and fork bearing sort of violence, like cold weapons.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	your assertion that native american culture does not influence our lives speaks of a profound isolation from native culture or a lack of understanding of our history.

Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	this life is much like a dream, but a dream that affects the dreams that will follow.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	only to realize, yet again, that it makes a giant fucking mess that you are going to have to clean up, and even if you do prefer waffles, it would only be a minor preference and, clearly, not worth the time, effort, or money spent on the appliance.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	stannis would do that.
Comparison of eating habits between smokers and non-smokers.	i think the difference is mostly visceral, and stems from the fact that eating food is viewed by most as pleasurable whereas a non smoker is unable to understand the craving of a smoker.	every single act of eating is therefore a balancing act, the likes of which smokers do not have to try.
Perceptions and Risks of Casual Sex.	casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	sex can be many different things to many different people.
Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	a person might be an atheist, that they reject the claim of the existence of a god, yet make no claim to knowing if they are correct or not.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	as our government does not ensure the same quality of life as many european countries do, i think we are more concerned with racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and so forth because we depend more on public opinion to ensure a decent quality of life.
Implications of the US government's actions on an individual.	with all of the world watching, how could the us government do anything to him ?	say he does have to go to court when he steps on us lands, and say he does get sentenced, punished, whatever.
Comparison of science and religion in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	while i agree that they may not become high contributing biological researchers, they certainly wo not necessarily become scientifically stunted.
Participation trophies and their impact on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	i think at very young ages it is ok for everyone to be winner.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	it also has reasoning capabilities, something people seem to use less and less.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	and finding a person that loves you back as much as you love them is worth a  heartbreaks.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	a fair amount of your grades come from just that.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	unjustified confidence can be dangerous, but it is perfectly fine if there is a rational reason for it.
Withdrawal from Cannabis Classification on Website	while withdrawal from cannabis has absolutely no drawbacks.	then you have never been through a marijuana withdrawal.
Negotiating car purchase with cash upfront.	cash up front gives me leverage to negotiate a better price on the purchase.	you can never return the money, so are you better off ? make sure this is actually true for your area.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	even fear does not destroy the people of gotham URL   one man ca not take down a criminal organisation, and it is not a good sign that someone has to resort in vigilantism in order to change things in gotham.
Philosophy in Literature	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	do you think it is not ? or are you using the word  art  to refer exclusively to the visual arts ? if so, what is it that the visual arts give us that poetry ca not ?.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	do you know how much it costs to move to a new state ? different places have different property values, so depending on where you live, you might not make enough money selling your current house to buy a new one wherever you want to live.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	it does not make you ignorant.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	let is take someone who uses stats.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	religion merely nurtures your personal and political views on sexual orientation, it does not directly nurture your sexual orientation.
Male understanding of female experience and desire for it.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	especially in school, where kids are mean anyways, lots of trans people commit suicide because they are mercilessly mocked.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	religious belief is a form of magical thinking that dispenses with criticla analysis it is a popular form of woo.
Collective action and political influence for social change.	the people can collectively rise up and overthrow those with unjust power.	how would this be accomplished ?.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	breaking it down point by point:   basing itself on sacred scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that  homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	the issue of violence on tv and that of nudity on tv are separate issues; one does not justify the other.
Federal government's control over constitution.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	under your argument that the federal government should only be concerned about human rights would mean that these issues should only be taken care of by the federal government and the states should take care of things like infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and things like that.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	i also respect the independence of cats.
Collective action and political influence for social change.	the people can collectively rise up and overthrow those with unjust power.	see where this is headed ? do you believe that this is something that this is a mechanism which is the purpose of capitalism, or something that just ends up happening ? is it possible that this happens because capitalism is  not  unchecked ? there are many laws that are anti capitalist in nature, which allow the powerful and wealthy to consolidate more power and wealth.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	unjustified confidence can be dangerous, but it is perfectly fine if there is a rational reason for it.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	my cat can leave anytime she wants to.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	i was told that it was a great show but not much else.
Morality and Personal Associations.	that does not make a person a shitty human being.	the assumption that selfishness is the optimal strategy is a testable assertion.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	i also believe that this is reprehensible.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	education, nasa, the fdic, food stamps, and many other small programs URL the vast majority of the money spent by the federal government is to a net benefit to the nation.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	all else is subjective and unpersuasive.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	this has less to do with the boomers, but is still something they have failed to react to.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	rape is unique because we claim to abhor it, but when it actually happens we usually try to find a reason why the victim was  asking for it  they were not careful enough; they were not clear enough about saying  no ; they are the sort of person who enjoys that sort of thing, etc.
Opinions on Donald Trump's wife, Melania.	but more importantly she does not appear like gold digger, she feels she earned everything with work.	i find it funny that every lady that i know immediately thinks she was sleeping donald.
Debate on punishment for criminals.	i hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.	this is divorced from the  actual  definition of felony, as used in our legal systems.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	what definition of religion are you using ? i ask because it is important for continuing the conversation.
Anti-Semitic sentiment during wartime.	hostilities against the jews were more intense because of the war.	i think you need to do more research.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	the mechanics of sex might be different and the relationship dynamic might be different only in the sense that because it is two people of the same gender that classic western gender roles have less influence.
Pizza sizes and confusion.	my point is that when places like dominos and pizza hut sell you s, m, l pies, you have no way to know what you are getting.	there is not a reason to standardize if they tell you what the sizes actually measure out to be already.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	your entire premise is wrong.
Overpaid athletes in professional sports.	for instance, nba players make tens of millions of dollars a year for what ?	because they can throw a ball into a hoop.
***Possible topic: The threat of infectious diseases.	we are overdue for a severe plague.	this sounds a bit like the gambler is fallacy URL moreover, as more and more of the world is explored, the remaining resevoirs for potential new hidden diseases becomes smaller however, there is a potentially relevant issue here that goes in the other direction: modern transport networks allow diseases to travel much faster: in particular, a novel air born disease would have a fun time with airplanes.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	customers understand this and use that to their advantage, making customer service a living hell.
Advantages of Neutral and Fixed Money.	in particular, i see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.	the us would have to be dissolved for us currency to not be honored.
Challenges of using chopsticks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	at least trees are renewable, even if the replantation efforts are not quite at the point of sustainability yet.
Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	if you genuinely believe fat shaming is dangerous, then you should put a premium on cultivating a productive and constructive gym atmosphere, encouraging people to come back and ensuring they do not r u n n o f t because the already fit people are assholes.
Opinions on tattoos as a superficial trend.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	i have also met people who have tattoos for aesthetic purposes only.
Human fetus and the use of the word "potential".	human fetus is a stage in the life of a human being.	human is a label we give to fully developed beings outside of the womb.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	it is also much more readily available, so people use the drug much more frequently.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	we do hold science as the answer because it has an amazing track record.
Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	i know there  are  women who claim that every man is literally a rapist, just as there  are  men that think every woman is a disgusting slut who needs to be eradicated, but that does not mean that the entire movement is invalid because some nutters have used it as a platform.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	which are you asking about ? why do you claim that is their motivation ? maybe they want to save the world and its economy.
Negotiating fair payment for services/goods.	the service/goods someone is providing exceeds the value of x dollars the buyer is offering.	all the worker is contributions are intermingled.
Risks and Rewards of Teenage Sex.	however, i feel like the risks of sex as a teenager far outweigh the rewards.	considering the fact that using birth control and a condom makes sex about as risky as driving a car.
Gender equality in front line warfighting jobs.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	we do not need to treat everyone  exactly the same  in order to adhere to equality ideals.
Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	i grew up in canada  drinking age in my province , weed was far easier to get than alcohol, but students managed to get both.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	anarchy and dictatorships would be worse than the current system.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	some of what you have said is just misinformed, some is wrong, and some might cause a bsod upon reading.
Russian aggression towards Ukraine.	the government of the united states and ukraine have both denounced russia is actions as against  international law .	that is mega illegal.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	but we both know you want to be in a relationship, but you are afraid things will not go the way you want them to.
Frustration with the American welfare system and desire to play games.	why ca not i just fuck the world and ask for the social welfare payment and play every days some good mmorpg games huh ?	what exactly do you think a  social welfare payment  is ? you can get unemployment income, but you have to have worked for a period of time, you have to keep looking for work, and it is temporary.
Misinterpretation of the phrase "I do not care"	even here, i would argue that the narrator does actually care about the consequences of her actions just not the consequences that most people would be thinking about when their car is totaled.	since your entire thesis seems to depend on this point, i think you may want to reconsider it.
Teenage driving safety and texting while driving.	teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	if you are going to prevent people who have jobs  is also the age for that , from diving to their job, then you should also be calling to raise the minimum working age to .
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	taxes do not change how productive the new hire is labor is, but they may effect how much of his productivity the company gets to keep.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	had she been harshly punished, the tullys would not have looked kindly upon it.
Sex as a reward for being a good person.	there is a common idea that for men perhaps for women as well, but moreso for men , sex and love are rewards for being a good person.	when the hero gets the girl in movies, sex is usually not involved.
Existence of phenomena and the role of an all-powerful God.	the existence of these phenomena would require an all powerful god to permit them.	but that  yet  makes no logical connection to your previous sentence.
Implications of the US government's actions on an individual.	with all of the world watching, how could the us government do anything to him ?	now this is purely anecdotal, but i can tell you that most people i know with some knowledge about this situation would probably agree that snowden did the right thing, but at the same time most of those people probably would not revolt if he were to be sent to jail.
Negative effects of participation trophies on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	take a look at professional sports, in addition to the fact that they all get paid, at the end of the season almost every professional team has a banquet or celebration of some kind so they can come together and recognize the efforts they all made that year, regardless of the end result.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	homosexuality encompasses more than just sex.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	you are not forced to help via taxes, you just want to help.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	poetry needs to be more concise and particular than any other form of literature.
The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	i challenge you to produce a single statement from the new testament in which jesus condemns someone who is gay.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	let is take another example using your logic.
Effects of Spanking on Children's Thinking and Behavior	spanking does not encourage critical thinking: child a:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy will hit me  child b:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy explained x will happen.	abuse may start early, but discipline does not.
Federal government's control over constitution.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	it can cost $ just to move a single person from coast to coast.
Parental Influence and Gender Roles.	similarly, two fathers ca not breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods.	none of us can address this, not knowing you.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	so some college kid gets sexually assaulted by most of the members of the football team, and the defense attempts to use the number of sex partners the kid had in the past to cast doubts over whether the assault which might have been caught on camera was actually  consensual.
Awareness of Jesus and religious persecution during the Holocaust.	obviously every single adult in a western country has heard of jesus already, and has had the opportunity to convert.	poor timing i will agree and i wo not defend this, but i will say that thousands of jehovah is witnesses and christians were killed in the holocaust, so it is not like they were just like  a jew gathering time to harass people.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	a lot of us draw some parallels with jewish culture because we face many of the same challenges, despite being totally different cultures.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	you may choose to walk again, but then, it will be far harder to compare your walking standards with your biking standards, even if you walk just as fast as your peak.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	i believe the first two indicate that being  pc  is a natural outcome of our demographics and history that simply is not as present in the more homogeneous countries of europe, and more necessary as it applies to a much larger group of people.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	for example, in our western world eyes, a chair is created when the pieces are all assembled and we can see that the chair physically exists.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	it takes just around °c warming for the costs clearly outweigh the benefits.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	it occurs when you try to analyse something repeatedly, but with no additional information.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	again, you could consider a focus on microeconomics.
Risk and uncertainty in life-saving decisions.	so gambling with a person a life without even guaranteeing the safety of others, is even less desirable.	but even if it did, what about the other fireflies ? if you are saying that doing something for the well being of your family makes it right then the fireflies are even more in the right than joel.
The effects of restricted nudity and internet pornography.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	already a thing, but this would be an argument for more conservative styles, not less people already no about nudity, cause they themselves do not always wear clothes, and have the internet to look up anything.
Cultural disintegration in a globalized world.	with the world becoming more and more of a melting pot, cultures seem to be disintegrating.	if you wish to preserve your local culture from external forces then you will need to cut all access to these influences would you be happy to do so ? if you are prepared to become this insular to preserve your culture, how do you propose to prevent cultural shifts from internal forces ? further the mixing of cultures can bring many benefits cuisine, arts, philosophy etc to all concerned.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	they do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.
Outrage culture and privilege.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	i do not find a comment like that offensive, i just think he is ignorant for saying it.
***Difficulties in discussing sensitive social topics in the US.	with all efforts to educate myself on topics such as obamacare, transgender, along with other major social topics in the us, there was always someone to  put me in my place  because of how much i offended them.	for example, the obama birther nonsense.
Criticism of Libertarianism and Government Monopolies.	i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.	libertarians simply do not support government handouts, affirmative action, and messing with the  invisible hand of the marketplace.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	having above average intelligence is irrelevant at this point.
The dangers of smoking and developing addiction.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	being  at college, you are far away from this situation, but you are open to this outcome.
Career expectations in the arts.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	a dream can be anything, from being an artist to being filthy rich.
Gender imbalance in the technology industry.	i just do not believe that forcing an uninterested party into an industry is the answer to a non existent problem.	do you really think assuming your stats are right that men and women are so vastly different that women are  times less interested in being part of the technology industry ? are you basing this on anything besides  gut feeling  ? are there less men in that industry ? i believe men actually dominate that industry URL too, at least at the highest levels.
Fear of Eternal Sleep.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	for an even more authentic experience, think general anaesthesia.
Comparison of Japan's acknowledgement of genocide and Germany's acknowledgement of the Holocaust.	and the japanese wo not even acknoledge the genocide in the same way germany does with the holocaust, that is just rubbing salt in the wound.	uh, what ? ! does the us, uk, russia, or france have generals still aching for payback ? does any country have generals that can even remember wwii ? hint: no.
Charitable activities of churches versus non-profit organizations.	anything that a church does charitably, such as fund an orphanage or collect donations for food aid, could be done by any other non profit organization and is done so regularly.	i agree that charitable things  could  be done.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	all things that can also happen in atheism.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	you remind me of the western otakus who want to move to japan, thinking that everybody there watches anime, listens to k pop and plays videogames on nintendo and sony consoles.
Cohl's peace after killing Childress and his role in religion.	however, after cohl and hart kill childress cohl seems truly at peace, even though he has not gotten the full truth or come anywhere near getting justice for the victims.	however, it is proof of a reward of somekind for his hard work and sufffering, and that motivates him to keep searching for the cult, which is on edge, as indicated by the lies reported in the news broadcast at the very end.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	we are not extremely competitive at soccer, though we have been getting better.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	if we get designed babies, who is to say they will be able to reproduce ? why would the companies that offer this service hurt their business model by allowing two  designed  babies to reproduce naturally ? if we can design babies, reproduction becomes too risky and tantamount to child endangerment.
Inconsistencies in Wolverine's claws in different movies.	you remember at the end of the wolverine when logan loses his metal claws and regrows the cool as fuck bone claws ?	he moved his conciseness over to a new host who was brain dead so he would have looked different, he would not have looked the same.
The validity of personal experiences in shaping beliefs.	you could change my view with study is or from experience yourself.	of course, correlation does not imply causation, and it is possible that my angry adolescent phase was short for other reasons.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	second, this sets a dangerous precedent.
Discipline of children and spanking as a form of punishment.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	embarrassment is a great disciplinary tool.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	the wire is ultimately a very clear expression of what it meant to be a poor american in the first decade of the st century.
The Thomistic Perspective on Homosexuality and Natural Law.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	what if i use my ears to hold up a pair of glasses instead of for hearing , or use my eyes to verify my identity instead of for seeing , etc.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	i see people rewarded for never once considering the ramifications of their actions or words simply because they convey confidence.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	military science was built on the backs of scientists and engineers who could build a better cannon and a better bomb.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.
Proper use of chopsticks for eating delicate food.	you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	a well practiced hand allows for the holding of food to come with no more effort than the holding of a fork.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	he tries to be objectively just, and is stubborn in the pursuit of it.
Patriarchy in Western Society	patriarchy is a simple term describing a society in which fathers are the heads of families, men are the heads of tribes and governments, etc; descent is traced through the male line; and so forth.	that is not the  the patriarchy  i mean.
Morality and Personal Associations.	that does not make a person a shitty human being.	they are a threat to me and mine.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	besides, the kind of person who enjoys risk taking like the thrill of unknown partners will likely be attracted to other forms of risk taking regardless, even if they stop indulging in casual sex, simply because they enjoy risk taking.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	but the long and the short of it is that a lot of people do not even know what constitutes rape, and there needs to be a conversation about consent with everyone.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	there is a very good reason why the skeptic takes the position of the rejection of a claim, as opposed to no claim about its validity, because then actions can actually be taken to test the position empirically.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	language is fluid.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	so for example, if you want patent protection, or trademark protection, or copyright protection, then the public can say what terms it will be done.
The Thomistic Perspective on Homosexuality and Natural Law.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	the catholic church has changed its teachings before e.
Same-sex marriages in a life simulation game.	there is a work around that allows same sex marriages, which is to make a male character a female or vise versa.	and why is it silly to be upset at children is games for not including same sex couples ? let me tell you that it sucks growing up as a gay child when every single romance option available to me is straight.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	if you are curious, but lack the confidence to pursue that which you are curious about.
Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	it is really not about how logical  you  feel it is.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	often there are witnesses to the lead up or the actual event itself.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	in addition it would be bad for business if companies could pay to alter the search results.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	source URL but the majority of these are made of bamboo which is a very renewable resource.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	for the  years i knew him he would choke and wheeze often with fits of emphysema.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	on the other hand, is it a problem if  every  movie or  most  movies do not have three dimension female characters ? is it a problem if, overall, your entire society has a high bmi ? is it a problem if, across all popular mainstream video games, they are all male dominated ? i am happy with saying  yes.
Purpose of affirmative action in college admissions.	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	because that unearned, pre decided trait determined that this person will go through life at a disadvantage when compared to the majority race.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	for instance, one might argue that the ability to make people is of supreme importance above all else and what makes a person a person.
Equality and Discrimination.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	using stereotypes is a terrible way to determine requirements.
The positive impact of religion on society.	i feel like the amount of charity people give to the world in the name of their faith more than balances these rare incidents.	there would still be wars, there would still but you need religion, or something like religion, namely dogma, to make a good person do bad things.
Immorality of not paying taxes.	and if you do not participate fully, you are an immoral person ?	is your disagreement with the manner in which taxes are used even representative of an inherent problem with taxation or is it about something else ? i do not think you need to feel morally obligated to give money to those people.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	we are still the same social creatures with our virtues, culture, and morals, but the one thing that has changed, is the knowledge we posses as a species.
The importance of mandatory writing courses in curriculum.	is there any reason at all to keep these courses in the curriculum, let alone mandatory ?	for me, it was a very diverse offering of literature from different time periods and places.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	how does this surprise you ? go cut down a tree.
Using chopsticks.	if you do pick something up with them, you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	are you sure you do not hold them wrong ? and unlike other utensils, chopsticks allow you to pick up food without having to stab it or otherwise damage it, which may be an advantage with certain foods.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	while this might be true of some religious persons, i am interdenominational.
Foreign aid and small business support in Africa.	i also feel more money should be spent on foreign aid, especially in the form of small business support in africa, for example.	you have to solve their long history of civil wars and corruption.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	no,  they  would not,  their  shareholders and employees would.
Debate on punishment for criminals.	i hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.	this is somewhat of a betrayal of your own premise, because the right to vote is only a topic for those who are already  out  of prison.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	it is not there to validate notions of your own intelligence.
Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	atheism and agnosticism are not different sides of the same coin, they are different coins being flipped for different questions.
The cost of being a superpower.	if we were no longer a superpower, we would not have to spend billions of dollars being be the policeman for other countries and trying and often failing to spread democracy elsewhere.	we could then keep more focus on our own internal affairs, and spend that money on our own citizens where it is needed.
Job dissatisfaction and management issues.	my managers overlook how much i help the company and how loyal i am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, i  talk back  too much.	if you want to have a managerial position, then  sucking up  is what gets the job done.
Success and Personal Capability	i am defining better here as how well equipped i am to be successful in achieving my goals in life.	of all the people whose goal is to become a navy seal, some succeed and others do not.
Bad decision making and quitting smoking.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	saying  smoking is cool  would be equivalent to  eating a lot of junk food is cool.
Disadvantages of smoking and the issue of respect.	i ca not see any reason for a rational person to smoke.	i think drinking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who drinks is kind off stupid.
The ending of a novel.	in the end he learns to love big brother and is finally happy, his last moment is one of complete bliss.	he has not  willearned  to love big brother.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	otherwise they just end it in a tie.
Genetic modification of non-disease traits in children.	but i would go farther to even argue that non disease traits should be altered by parents to give children better outcomes.	why not let the kid be his own person ? speaking personally, if someone came to me today and offered to  augment  my genes, i absolutely not want it.

Correlation between test scores and preparation methods.	however, there is a very strong correlation between act/sat scores and the amount of time/money put into preparing for them.	there needs to be some way to measure ability so colleges know who they want to accept, and knowing whether a student is good at taking tests and learning information seems pretty useful.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	like what ? the people would never accept him, not only because of his horrible personality, the people accepted joffrey, and he would have remained king if not for a massive conspiracy against him.

Controversy over offensive sports team names.	while i understand why a team name like  redskins  is a bigoted name, i do not understand why people get offended over something so inconsequential.	i do not think my girlfriend  ought to be upset  when i say something innocuous that sets her off because she is hormonal, but i do  understand why innocuous things can set her off when she is hormonal.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	but most crimes come down to witness testimony, if it exists, and  he said, she said  stuff.
The lack of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	why does such a place need to exist ? why ca not consciousness be each individual part of the brain working together ? look at it like a computer.

Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	and maybe it is just a matter of waiting it out but i do not think we can afford to wait.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	after that, the largest chunk of the money is spent on defense, which has directly paid your salary as you were in the military and likely paid for your college if you went under the gi bill.
The role of faith in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	if that is not how god works, then what is the point ? an entity with no effect on anything is no better than imaginary.
Ethical dilemma of sacrificing one life to save many.	a father is first priority in that situation, is the well being of his daughter.	quite possibly, in that apocalyptic world, even above the lives of all mankind.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	do what is right in your short life to make the world a better place.
Smoking and societal attitudes towards it.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	if you want that experience you could do it with something less horrible for your body, and less addicting.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	the public does have the right to controlling itself though, right ? yes, you should.
Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	the question is, when someone is raped, is it helpful just to shrug and say  rapists are rapists, that is just life  or to examine the social climate that could lead to these rape rates ? the other side of the coin is male issues.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	oh, she is actually batshit crazy, thinks she was abducted by aliens, actually has a penis phobia but is attracted to men , insane jealousy of you  looking  at any other women, thinks if you do other activities it means you do not like her as much, etc.
Job satisfaction and career aspirations.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	not because i like coding  hours a day like a freak, but so i can hopefully create some start up and make good money.
Effectiveness of Advertising.	i have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.	maybe your doctor is not fixing it to your satisfaction, maybe its something over the counter and not doctor worthy like hair loss.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	the aversion to natural things, breast feeding and children playing in the nude, are arguably less because of a fear of offending others, and more of a fear of having a creeper come by i.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	there is absolutely nothing to suggest an external source of consciousness.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	there are similar reasons for the popularity of jane austen and charles dickens.
Inappropriate clothing and sexualization of girls.	in my opinion these types of shorts reveal way to much.	we are pattern recognizing machines, and your brain takes these images of hip bones and bottoms and searches though memories for similar shapes.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	while some criminals will profit from getting into the illegal cigarette business, it seems like the majority of smokers are law abiding citizens who otherwise have no involvement in the criminal world.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	i like the open web too, but do i have a right to it ? well, i have already shown that the public  did  create the service, but importantly we are not talking about something that nearly everyone  uses  we are talking about something that nearly everyone  relies upon  in a very important way.
The nature of evidence and how it relates to God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	if you might agree that to believe something you need evidence, then why not the best available evidence that is potentially available to everyone ?.
The validity of personal experiences in shaping beliefs.	you could change my view with study is or from experience yourself.	i travel through life on a much more even keel when i masturbate regularly.
Advantages of Neutral and Fixed Money.	in particular, i see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.	the us dollar is already a widely accepted global standard of money.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	because they are a human being who is struggling to get by.
Advantages of Neutral and Fixed Money.	in particular, i see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.	it is inevitable that bitcoins will continue to be lost, and eventually we will run against the limit of divisibility with the coins that are still in circulation.
Future MMORPG games and their immersive experience.	most of mmorpg games thats coming in future will be much better then what i have played before.	less, if anything.
Dangers of texting while driving.	texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	teens are not the only ones texting and driving, i can guarantee that.
Job satisfaction and career aspirations.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	i think making your hobby into a job will  make you very little money for the time you spend  make you hate your hobby because a job is always going to be more restrictive than a hobby  a lot of college students go into less lucrative degrees because they came straight out of high school and do not realize the truth about being an adult with day to day expenses.
Benefits of Vaccinations Outweigh Risks	the evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.	evidence existing does not equal evidence being readily available to the person or the individual being able to understand the evidence.
Introverts' discomfort with extroverts' questioning.	i have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being  forced to talk  by being asked questions.	in the first case, the complainer has no good grounds for complaint, in the second, discourteous behavior is being rightly complained about.
Benefits of Vaccinations Outweigh Risks	the evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.	being stupid and/or ignorant is not the same thing as being delusional.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	actually monopoly concerns have caused google to have to prove that companies cannot do that which is why all the paid advertisements are not part of the actual results.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	i think many of those effects can be also achieved by jobs that require you to socialize, or by being friendly in the right locales.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	these are the drinks that every bartender should know how to make.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	bullying in school can also happen with the parents being interracial, the parents not being a common religion, or being disabled.
Introverts' discomfort with extroverts' questioning.	i have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being  forced to talk  by being asked questions.	the number of introverts who are impacted by the social bias towards extroverts is small because only a minority of introverts are unable to secure enough alone time to recharge.
Effects of Spanking on Children's Thinking and Behavior	spanking does not encourage critical thinking: child a:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy will hit me  child b:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy explained x will happen.	the goal is listening to the parents, and doing what they say, and not talking back.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	creating corporate taxes as an unnecessary addition to individual taxes is like the ruler on the island who forces someone to spend his time doing something unproductive, where it would be better to let that person do something different.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	let me compare and contrast two bars i have been to/frequented in the past.
Debate on the effectiveness of killing to solve problems.	when we can just rid the world of these things by killing them.	another part of why people should be able to help and as you put it  a second chance at life  is due to the myriad of reasons why a person may have committed a crime.
Philosophy vs Science.	there is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist ca not.	people have different disciplines for a reason.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	my strengths lie in literature and english.
Password Security and Formula Usage.	ideally, passwords should not be reused, and a formula should be used to generate unique passwords for each account you have.	the question is, is it more likely that an attacker could crack public key encryption, which is widely audited and as long as p ! np verifiable with mathematically proven concepts, or that they could crack your password generation algorithm, which you probably secretly came up with yourself ? i expect that for any human rememberable password generation algorithm, that an attacker with a single  generated  clear text password could crack all your other passwords with brute force just by stemming from your original.
Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	as for the body of your argument, since you say that women have achieved  equality  i am going to assume that you believe no gender issues exist in modern western society.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	i believe you should feel morally obligated to pay taxes, in large part because your success in life would not have happened without others having their wealth redistributed to your benefit.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	she might be horrible, but you are equally responsible.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	you sound like you are not so convinced.
Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	that is only one of the many issues, most people start with hormone replacement therapy, then surgery following a long time in hrt, there are even those who elect not to undergo surgery.
Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	some corrections:  robb stark was a terrible leader.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	they just want someone who will protect them.
The problem of evil in philosophy.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	this is probably the most solid answer that i am aware of; however, it kind of hoses the idea of god is omnibenevolence in the first place.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	i am not someone who dislikes learning.
Benefits of being single vs being in a relationship.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	you are trading time and money for companionship and reciprocated affection.
Criminal disenfranchisement and empathy-based morality in voting rights.	if we can agree that laws are based on commonly accepted standards of morality and that morality is based on empathy, then people who have proven their lack of empathy through their own criminality should  almost by definition  not be given the right to vote.	the right to vote should not be a privilege, because all you gain by disenfranchising a population is a lack of representation  of  that population.
Identity and the effects of drugs/alcohol on perception.	i have observed that while high/drunk users exhibit and/or report that their emotions, perceptions, thought processes, behavior, and memory are altered, if only temporarily.	likewise your identity then can be seen as who you have been over your lifetime.
Criticism of rural group's barbaric behavior.	by comparison, her whole group proceeded to fight and scream at each other throughout the whole night, completely fail at mounting an effective defense or escape, and ended up killing each other/getting eaten until she was the only one left.	after all, urban locations are probably far worse for a zombie apocalypse.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	this is silly and irrelevant, some sort of bizarre false analogy not worth exploring.
Criminal disenfranchisement and empathy-based morality in voting rights.	if we can agree that laws are based on commonly accepted standards of morality and that morality is based on empathy, then people who have proven their lack of empathy through their own criminality should  almost by definition  not be given the right to vote.	by not allowing them to have an impact, you create a class of citizens that have  no one advocating for them at all.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	if god did exist, he would be natural by definition.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	onto the plumber, a plumber knows how to use a wrench, should, that is more akin to a bartender knowing how to mix a drink, not what kind of drink they can mix.
Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	so is this about how fat shaming might be dangerous or how you hate fat people ? because they are two different conversations.
Training dogs for different purposes.	dogs can be trained to smell cancer, sense danger, lead the blind or disabled, or simply do a number of amusing tricks.	personally i prefer cats as a pet because they need less work.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	to that end, it is idiotic to mandate that two fifteen year old kids ca not have sex with each other, but this is not the argument here.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	you must make the change without information.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	hitler still wanted war with the east.
Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	synthetic rubber.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	complete morality is the strongest secular position.
Success and Personal Capability	i am defining better here as how well equipped i am to be successful in achieving my goals in life.	it is inherent simply in being a human being.
Beauty pageants and child safety.	from what i have seen, beauty pageants take on a  cutesy  vibe, not a sexual one.	none of the kids seem to be in any immediate danger, and of course every law in place to protect kids still applies.
Teenage driving safety and texting while driving.	teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	more laws, and less freedom is not a good answer for some simple security.
Smoking and Suicide Prevention	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	i know that i would prefer to be supportive to individuals who are harming themselves or contemplating doing so, rather than labeling them as stupid and shunning them.
Eliminating the use of the word "potential" in reference to humans.	as a last point, what else, if not a human ?	the terms are  human fetus  and  human infant.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	what will become of our society when our achievements are not our own ? the success you have in life will be determined by the financial ability of your parents to purchase the best design.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	however, i do not begrudge people is right to believe as they wish i want that right for myself too.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	imagine  people live on an island.
Opinions on Acting Skill and Roleplaying.	i find bad acting very cringey, and i do not act well so trying out roleplaying/watching other people act badly does not appeal to me.	every actor who has ever acted, with very few exceptions, has been a bad actor at some point.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	so would thousands of others.
Teenage driving safety and texting while driving.	teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	my first illegal drug was nicotine at age .
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	in these situations i find it is helpful to look at the person is achievements in life.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	combined with the already low risk of their partner having an std, some may consider it worth it.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	when we condone one aspect of risk taking behavior, such as casual sex, we also condone other forms of risk taking behavior, such as drugs and gambling.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	you sound like you are not so convinced.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	the worst diplomatic blunder, was attempting to appease hitler.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	the problem with carefully considering a situation before proceeding is that you may get analysis paralysis.
Effectiveness of Advertising.	i have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.	it needs to effect you when you are weak.
Password Security and Formula Usage.	ideally, passwords should not be reused, and a formula should be used to generate unique passwords for each account you have.	so what is more likely ? they crack  bit encryption and/or your one hopefully very secure passphrase for that encrypted password file, or that they crack one or two of your other passwords you  know  not every account you have, and i would guess probably less than half, uses proper hashes, do not you ?.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	school is not there to make you feel smart.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	you also have some misinformation about cats.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	it is not an error to point out an error with out correcting it.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	over thinking can definitely be a problem.
Suicide and its reasons.	suicide is almost always tragic, misguided and ultimately futile.	the motivation could not possibly be just a simple,  i do not want to live anymore  ? i would find that to be such an eminently worthy reason to kill oneself.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	it is an extremely difficult addiction.
Government's role in marriage.	which made me ask, why the government was even involved in marriage in the first place.	or even allows corporations and businesses.
Criticism of a writer's skills and downvotes.	and for having a lot of discussion, what is up with the pile of downvotes ?	topic has not been seen here before, and it is fresh topic friday.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	°c, which is the best estimate for no serious efforts taken to stop the warming would be a dystopian world.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	but i ca not find the article.
Ethical dilemma of sacrificing one life to save many.	a father is first priority in that situation, is the well being of his daughter.	if you want to argue those deaths were justifiable to save a life, then i could also argue that killing ellie is justifiable due to the amount of lives the cure would save.
Subjectivity of Monetary Value and Understanding Price Determination Systems.	that is, i think that monetary value is inherently subjective and that we do not usefully understand the systems that determine the price of a good, or an appropriate salary for work performed.	what you describe here would essentially force the economy to be a command economy, we would need a central authority deciding how much everyone should be paid which would inherently drive the costs of goods and services.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	their dreams are what they want from life, whether their goals be personal, financial, etc.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	according to cornell is law library URL the definition of a militia in the us is: a the militia of the united states consists of all able bodied males at least  years of age and, except as provided in section  of title , under  years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the united states and of female citizens of the united states who are members of the national guard.
Physical effects of injury.	that is because the effects on the body can be physically scarring.	i do not see how that makes it any less bad.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	this is a societal issue and only what society as a whole decides to approve as morally right or not morally wrong gets accepted.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	while this might be true of some religious persons, i am interdenominational.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	nobility is something passed down through family lines.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	like what ? the people would never accept him, not only because of his horrible personality, the people accepted joffrey, and he would have remained king if not for a massive conspiracy against him.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	why are you so afraid of stuff going wrong ? shit happens in life, and you get over it.
Gotham City's Crime and Corruption.	the city is plagued by psychotic villains who steal and kill constantly, who seem to manipulate or break their way out of prison with fearful ease.	blaming them on gotham is just a cop out.
Criticism of Libertarianism and Government Monopolies.	i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.	they believe in social and financial freedom be who you want to be and support yourself; do not force others to pay for your xyz.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	it was not until companies like aol started to see a profit that any private investment and control happened to the industry.
Responsibility and Authority in Children's Behavior	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	it is about fear and authority, and subordination.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	i think it is a bad decision on the part of chipotle and it makes me angry that they would cave to the anti gun people.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	and just fuckin  fix it, in this context, means making more video games with female characters in them.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	as for why you should do good things, i will put it this way: has anyone ever done anything for you that made you happy ? bonus points if it was a random act of kindness.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	if you dislike my sources, provide more and better sources.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	so we have established at this point in my argument that it is neither nurture nor nature.
***Difficulties in discussing sensitive social topics in the US.	with all efforts to educate myself on topics such as obamacare, transgender, along with other major social topics in the us, there was always someone to  put me in my place  because of how much i offended them.	however, can i ask if you if perhaps you could consider that some of your  questions  were presented in an offensive manner ? i have seen some politician make some inflammatory statement or another, then attempt to defend it by claiming they were  just wondering if.
Tipping and servers' wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	if someone can post proof of their paychecks in  seperate pay periods for their restaurant, and a ledger showing their hours to back up that they were shafted, i will gladly give gold.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	if corporate interests are your concern then deregulation is worse than regulation.
Cultural disintegration in a globalized world.	with the world becoming more and more of a melting pot, cultures seem to be disintegrating.	can you honestly say that your culture has not changed significantly since the start of last century ? even in the last  years ?.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	in a lot of languages these noises are considered a speech impediment.
Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	and thank the gods for it.
Philosophical Writing	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	that is it.
Psychopathy as a mental illness.	rodger left a lucid, coherent explanation of his crimes.	it is not credible to disregard that explanation and offer a different one i.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	every guy in my class admitted that has at least once watched a porn movie.
Identity and the effects of drugs/alcohol on perception.	i have observed that while high/drunk users exhibit and/or report that their emotions, perceptions, thought processes, behavior, and memory are altered, if only temporarily.	think of graphs over time, the specific value changes as time progresses, however it remains the same graph with perhaps the same function.
Baker refusing to make cake for polygamous marriage.	what if a baker refused to make a cake for a polygamous marriage ?	in this case it is society via government which is enforcing this.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	baby boomers almost crippled our economy i am aware of the generalization here, just bear with me  because  they did not question the policies of these men.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	i am going to be a scientist, which means my required writing expertise is in producing bland academic papers.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	to claim that atheism, by necessity is irrational, is wrong, see self replies for addressing.
The role of religion in preventing evil and war.	there would still be wars, there would still be people who rose to positions of power for their own benefit.	it is a specific example of the tangible results of dogmatic beliefs.
Morality and Personal Associations.	that does not make a person a shitty human being.	i would rather be good mostly anyway than evil because it is more advantageous for me in life.
Immorality of not paying taxes.	and if you do not participate fully, you are an immoral person ?	i would not go that far, personally.
Pizza sizes and confusion.	my point is that when places like dominos and pizza hut sell you s, m, l pies, you have no way to know what you are getting.	people do not want to do math when watching a tv, even if it is a simple measurement like   that they are all accustomed to.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	cloves are a valid option, you will get all the physical sensations minus the nicotine.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	in other words, acts of continuous self betrayal are acts of mental suicide.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	we just do not know currently what the requirements are, and to claim otherwise is to assert something without evidence.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	when our genetic fate is determined by money, then money determines your attractiveness, health, and ability.
The impact of animals on human survival.	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	well we are adapting by beginning to care about the climate.
Software failures in vehicles.	why the point as software failures, malfunctions or whatever would mean you ca not go anywhere.	these wrecks killed , people and injured another  million.
Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	that is probably because those jobs are really intellectually easy jobs that do not actually require people to be all that smart.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	moreover, i would argue that the introduction of homemade porn, which is very rapidly growing and depicts realistic bodies, people, and sexual performance, is actually very beneficial for these reasons.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	it is my understanding that sexual orientation is influenced by the hormones a fetus is exposed to in the womb, and there are an increasing number of studies that show hormones in the womb also lead to other  characteristics  including anxiety disorder and depression.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	but if i asked them for a jagerbomb literally just a shot of jagermeister in a cup of red bull , they would give me a blank stare and say  a what ?   the other was a metal club that served so many jagerbombs they had their own cups made so that the shot of jager was held in the middle of the red bull and it mixed as you drank it.

Economic modeling and impact of a policy.	as such i feel all debate around the topic right now is pretty meaningless.	they would need to study the past behavior of higher income earning individuals, profitable corporations and small business response to tax increases or overhead increases in general to discover what how much of a financial incentive will cause them to start to leave the country.

Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	however, maybe it  is  sexist that so many games get made about male dominated activities such as killing in the first place  opinion: i am somewhat of the opinion that, we can either sit around here talking about a problem, or we can just fuckin  fix it.

Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	it is what i said earlier.
The Thomistic Perspective on Homosexuality and Natural Law.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	? or if i use the same motions usually used for walking and running, to power a bicycle ? are they immoral uses of my organs because they are not their intended purposes ? also, if you start off with a definition of sexual acts as being  those activities that potentially lead to procreation  or similar wording , you essentially define homosexual acts as not actually being sexual acts.

Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	closing the sexual act to the gift of life is exactly as bad as birth control, and the lack of a genuine relationship is simply false.

Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	you may feel this way, but the people who have casual sex clearly do not.
Opinions on tattoos as a superficial trend.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	and unless you speak with a person who has a tattoo and they are willing to share the meaning of the tattoo, which some people are not because it is private information they do not want to share with a nosy stranger , you will never know if it has some sort of meaning beyond  it looks cool  or not, and you ca not assume based on the subject of the tattoo whether it is meaningful or not appearances are deceptive.

The Definition of Atheism and Belief in Mythological Gods	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	what would an agnostic do ? they have been presented evidence, at that moment they would need to either decide if that evidence is sufficient to sway their belief or concoct some scheme so that they can be non committal in the face of evidence.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	the most disastrous of which was britain is war guarantee to poland.

Trend of best-selling Wii games for casual players.	if you analyze the list of best selling games on the wii including wii sports, mario kart wii, wii sports resort, new super mario bros.	so, for a sacrifice of a bit on the sales of the game for not being as casual as it could be you would be able to sell a substantial amount of new consoles because without that there would be no reason for the hardcores to even own a wiiu.
Relationship between religion and science.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.	odd considering the majority of knowledge preserved in western society was done so in christian monasteries and muslim libraries.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	you make a good point and its worth clearing this up.

Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	dwelling on the past, and attempting to hold people accountable for the wrongdoings of the long dead will accomplish nothing.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	with that low income tax burden, corporations hired more people including african americans in the  is, by the way unemployment among african americans was a low.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	your ability to learn and be edified, i feel, is directly hindered by self confidence.

Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	they were treated horribly, betrayed and killed and every other thing you can think of, but if the plan had been to kill all the natives, believe me when i say there would not be  million alive today.

Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	not sure about india but in the us, whenever people complain about not being  allowed  to say something, they are  lying.

Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	is your disagreement with the manner in which taxes are used even representative of an inherent problem with taxation or is it about something else ? i do not think you need to feel morally obligated to give money to those people.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.
The difficulty of winning the war against terrorism.	we could literally blow up every remaining terrorist, and we still would have lost the war.	it is more difficult than just killing them off.
Importance of musical literacy for performers.	to be a skilled performer without musical literacy is analogous to a great storyteller who neither read nor write.	cmv ! but there is nothing that prevents an illiterate man from being a great storyteller.

Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	it also shoots a hole in your argument when most of the network building that private companies of done for the internet came from grants and funds from the government to help them build out the networks.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	one argument in favour of polyamory was that people involved wanted to explore their sexuality with other partners without having to lie about it and resort to cheating which they are against.
Debate over the moral high ground of the South in the Civil War.	i also believe the south had the moral high ground in the war.	believe the north was the aggressor and it can never be morally correct to fight a war if it is not strictly for self defense.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	we should not teach children to follow their dreams, we should teach them how to survive in this world.
Using chopsticks.	if you do pick something up with them, you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	whereas with a fork, i can stab a bite of food and have it on little mini skewers, which requires much less effort.

Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	it is not much about having more money or reducing unemployment; it is more about a supply side boost to the economy.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	but sure, maybe you read something that is nonsense somewhere.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	most religious incarnations put responsibility of ones actions on the individual.

***Difficulties in discussing sensitive social topics in the US.	with all efforts to educate myself on topics such as obamacare, transgender, along with other major social topics in the us, there was always someone to  put me in my place  because of how much i offended them.	think about how many people were just  wondering  if it was legitimate or some such.
Limiting voting rights to educated individuals.	not allowing uneducated people to vote would also reduce the influence of racism and other popular yet often incorrect opinions.	someone in chemistry would not have been forced to do that research.
Misconceptions about the size of the USA and Europe.	i feel like many europeans really do not understand how large the usa is.	that is like if i went to the us and said,  well, i drove by car from new york to philadelphia and it was not  that  far !   yeah, of course it is not.
Government's role in contract enforcement.	so why would the government want to ease your financial life when you fall deeply in love with someone else ?	it is the same reason the government works to give you clean air, reduces noises, provides transportation avenues, and supports public education.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	i am asking for cmv arguments that look at why a maximum salary has little merit and so, why financial motivation is so strong a driver, despite the evidence that it does not making people any happier.
Hunting and its impact on wildlife conservation.	hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence.	what you are talking about is market hunting.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	then you fail to grasp the reason for them.
Overpaid athletes in professional sports.	for instance, nba players make tens of millions of dollars a year for what ?	the players are the face of the game.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	while this seems sound, i do not think it is actually true.
Collective action and political influence for social change.	the people can collectively rise up and overthrow those with unjust power.	these are things that may cause the cycle of events that you have outlined, but they are also things that are done to  check  capitalism.
Identity and the effects of drugs/alcohol on perception.	i have observed that while high/drunk users exhibit and/or report that their emotions, perceptions, thought processes, behavior, and memory are altered, if only temporarily.	like many others have mentioned, those traits you claim to define one is self does keep changing already.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	in the long term ? expect something like venus, where you have got a surface temperature of over  c  f , an atmosphere that is extremely dense, and it rains concentrated sulfuric acid.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	none of the policies reagan introduced can therefore possibly be blamed on the baby boomer generation.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	if the ruler stops dictating that  person do something that is not helpful to anyone, then that person can now do something more helpful, such as specializing in making tools to help the farmer and fisher produce and catch more food.
Negative effects of participation trophies on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	it does not give kids something to strive for or work towards.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	i did not know the reputation of the show when i started watching it.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	he may want to think so, it fits his persecution complex, but that is just his own failings coming to bear.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	it even has possible career paths and real world uses.
Negative effects of participation trophies on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	this is the one sentence i want to address, and i am sure others have as well.
Inconsistencies in Wolverine's claws in different movies.	you remember at the end of the wolverine when logan loses his metal claws and regrows the cool as fuck bone claws ?	he is back with no reason given, and do not say it was explained at the end of x after the credits as it was not.
Physical effects of injury.	that is because the effects on the body can be physically scarring.	it seems so silly and fake, but it achieves a terrifying simulation of something more, all the while being just that; simulated.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	well, what are you going to do about it ? i choose to live my life as though there is nothing beyond death because of my own beliefs.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	would this method of changing up the old guard be effective in ridding the house and senate of  self interested, incumbent politicians ? i do not think so, to be honest.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	look at new york for instance, where it is perfectly legal for women to go topless.
The effectiveness of moral methods in helping people.	using moral means/methods to  cleanse/cure  these people is just a joke.	people may suffer from mental disorders, they may have made a mistake or various different mistakes, they may have been motivated by various different circumstances.
Relationship between religion and science.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.	who is assuming this ? which religion encourages this ? i cannot think of one off the top of my head.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	we do not.
Morality and cheating.	i am arguing that there is no pragmatic reason why you should not cheat.	that should be enough reason to not do it right there, and if it is not, i think it is a poor reflection on you.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	they are rewarded for being obnoxious because managers and workers by extension are told by corporate to leave their human dignity at the door and do as they say.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	you must trust yourself and you must want new information.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	i personally feel that there is a major amount of over sensitivity when it comes to people voicing their beliefs about certain social issues.
Gender Equality and Chivalry	i do not think you can have gender equality and chivalry coexist.	we are sexually dimorphic, there is no such thing as gender equality.
Chopsticks and their practicality.	but for practically everything else, there is just no god damn reason to use chopsticks when western utensils are more practical, and better for the environment.	the practically is that they are not weapons like knives and forks, and they were invented before the spoon:  t is commonly known that the chinese invented chopsticks or kuaizi in chinese as a set of instruments to be used when eating but the reason behind that is not commonly known.
Reducing genetic diversity.	i do not consider reduction of genetic diversity a real problem.	why not let the kid be his own person ? speaking personally, if someone came to me today and offered to  augment  my genes, i absolutely not want it.
Negative effects of technological conveniences.	the darker side is that technological conveniences are often less necessary.	how does technology usage hurt my individuality in any meaningful way ? as far as health goes, go to the gym or eat better food.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	sex by itself is not unproductive or a waste of time because of the intimacy factor, as explained previously , but meaningless sex is.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	sure, why not ? never put a roof over your head ? turned on an ac ? heck, it is easily demonstrable what impact a volcanic eruption will have on climate, human beings could replicate the effect if desired, and you can see the reports of what happened after / or the icelandic volcano eruptions when many flights are grounded.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	or paying for something without exposing your credit card and personal information.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	no one wants to wait an extra day for the conclusion of an event, and it can potentially conflict with the next scheduled soccer match or events going on at the stadium.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	personally, i do not have faith.
Theoretical limits of modeling particles in the universe.	theoretically speaking, if methuselah lived long enough and had enough clay tablets he could perform all of the calculations necessary to model all of the particles in the universe.	this is data abstracted, it has no mechanism by which to act.
Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	bird watching is rather hard when many of the birds are gone during the winter.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	he would then be renly is heir renly could make the best of the situation by backing stannis, and then all of that good stuff happens.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	would you agree that i should not have to take classes in english and literature ? god forbid a difficult subject took you down a notch.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	if attractiveness is a concern for you, then there is a profile picture, you can filter your selection down pretty quickly.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	the fact they then invaded and occupied half of poland does not dissuade you from this thinking ? what about the fact that hitler only claimed to want the sudetenland from czechoslovakia in , as some germans a minority lived there ? he quite quickly took the rest of czechoslovakia after he would been given the sudetenland.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	the principle that  is  more significant than other discoveries such as evolution is  causality.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	some tribes and peoples recognized this and others did not, i do not know how much they could have actually done about anything in the long run but here we are.
Training dogs for different purposes.	dogs can be trained to smell cancer, sense danger, lead the blind or disabled, or simply do a number of amusing tricks.	i do not want to have to walk my cat several times a day.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	corn is far and away america is largest staple crop, and all parts of it are used in our manufacturing, food, and almost every other industry.
Patriarchy in Western Society	patriarchy is a simple term describing a society in which fathers are the heads of families, men are the heads of tribes and governments, etc; descent is traced through the male line; and so forth.	and so you acknowledge, at least, that it exists.
Discipline and Spanking in Children's Behavior.	kids these days are unruly and need to be taught discipline !	further, the kids who are the worst behaved are going to be punished the most.
Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	the definition you have provided is bad.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	while i agree that they may not become high contributing biological researchers, they certainly wo not necessarily become scientifically stunted.
Subjectivity of opinions on musicians and people.	there are loads of better musicians and many more interesting people.	they have stylists spend more time on their hair and make up then they actually spend in the studio.
Immigration and US Economy	why ca not we shuffle around illegal immigrants into other developed countries in order to lessen the strain on the us economy ?	count yourself lucky maine has to help texas, arizona, new mexico and california.
The meaning of "God" in the context of religion.	change my view that god should represent the shared human concept of existence for people who claim to be religious, as anything less thought out than that basically implies that the word  god  has no more meaning within the framework of our reality.	because this is not the view of the vast majority of people who use the term.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	how would it be fair to people who are still following the tax laws if you ignore them ? people would never be able to become successful while following the rules if there are people breaking the rules to get ahead.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	we perceive things exclusively through brain activity.
Men's primary concern: Romantic Love.	men, however  do  have romantic love as their primary concern.	romantic love is a secondary concern to them.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	colonization of north america was just an invasion in slow motion.
Criteria for Involuntary Admission Scheduling.	note that criteria for involuntary admission scheduling varies between states and countries but generally includes risk of harm to self, or to others.	thus, a person who holds an anti vaccination belief is delusional, and may be diagnosed as having delusional disorder.
Challenges of using chopsticks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	whereas with a fork, i can stab a bite of food and have it on little mini skewers, which requires much less effort.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	logic, rationality, science, etc.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	it kind of sounds like you are a sociopath.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	but i know so many people who smoke, and they all seem fine to me.
Debate: Dog vs. Cat as a Household Pet	i believe that when looked at objectively, a dog is a better potential companion in a household as a pet than a cat.	it should be clear why many of the examples you cite rely heavily upon such attitudes and preferences.
Grades and job preparedness.	students are coddled and are not prepared for when grades do not exist and their jobs are at stake.	why ? perhaps teachers or districts have provided easier curriculum and homework.
Debate: Dog vs. Cat as a Household Pet	i believe that when looked at objectively, a dog is a better potential companion in a household as a pet than a cat.	it is subjective.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	practice makes permanent, so by learning from parents and other good role models and practicing a lot you will have better adjusted and overall better drivers when they become adults.
***Possible topic: The threat of infectious diseases.	we are overdue for a severe plague.	unfortunately, this may be the mother of all survivorship biases URL if species once they develop nukes do frequently wipe themselves out, the only observes around will note that their species have been very peaceful after the construction of nuclear weapons.
Gender Equality and Chivalry	i do not think you can have gender equality and chivalry coexist.	it never has existed, it is a pipe dream.
Atheism and the Path to Finding God	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	there is no evidence that the path to god is trust apart from religious text, so this argument is invalid.
Existence of God and Problem of Evil.	i can only conclude that there either is no god, or that there is a god not worthy of admiration and praise.	what was i comparing this universe with when i called it unjust ? also, the problem of evil is brought up.
Capitalism and its limitations.	for another, competition becomes impractical after a point; try starting an isp, or a car company, or a petrochemical company.	these are things that may cause the cycle of events that you have outlined, but they are also things that are done to  check  capitalism.
Gender identity and transition options.	i feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the  i feel like i should have been male/female  argument.	it is very difficult to explain.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	if your view is from the result of a position which is in error, then simply pointing out the error should be sufficient enough for you to reconsider your view.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	personally the way how the page was used in the  book of dead leaves  to create this maddening sense as you read really opened my world about how poetry can influence other things.
Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	the obnoxious customers know  exactly  what they are doing, so hardly them being stupid.
Trading with countries with poor human rights records.	why would one trade with a country that has poor human rights records ?	even this one ? think about it.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	find a lung cancer ward, or find people who had complications with smoking, you will see what sort of damage it can cause.
Existence of God and its worthiness of admiration.	i can only conclude that there either is no god, or that there is a god not worthy of admiration and praise.	but that  yet  makes no logical connection to your previous sentence.
Dangers of texting while driving.	texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	teenagers, need vehicles too.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	too much confidence is hubris.
Chopsticks and Soup Eating Customs.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	i understand this and sympathize, but people also slurp from spoons, so i do not see how this is any worse.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	i encourage you to view it with an open mind: URL  at a young age i was informed by my religious parents that any act of affection towards one of the same sex is a bad thing.
Obesity and Bad Decision Making.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	in america, it is nigh impossible to avoid food i should not eat if i want to lose weight.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	and the truly moral man would not just as quickly.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	you cannot go into a steak restaurant, eat a steak, then claim they want to steal $ from you.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	people want  this  congress to have term limits because right now the system is not working.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	i believe you should feel morally obligated to pay taxes, in large part because your success in life would not have happened without others having their wealth redistributed to your benefit.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	while i do not want to be horribly ethnocentric, and i know etiquette is a cultural construct, i find that practice to be absolutely revolting.
Income inequality and its effects on society.	in the countries which have the least income inequality the scandinavian countries and japan crime and poverty are reduced, but birth rates are unusually low and depression is high.	because sweden has mental health care than iran.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	basically no life on earth is adapted to such hot climate.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	i find this very hypocritical.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	is it a problem that a given movie does not have two women talking to each other about not men ? not necessarily.
Judgment towards drug preferences.	nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring lsd or mdma.	addictive drugs should be considered more akin to tobacco: definitely a bad habit to start, and generally not worth trying at all.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	its fantastic art but it been done, and it does not inspire same way like post modern pieces.
Naming children after deceased family members.	i am someone who is named after a deceased family member.	i had a grandfather who also suffered with dementia and he thought i was my father whose name i do not share.
Philosophy vs. Science	there is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist ca not.	philosophy answers  why , science cannot answer this.

Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	he failed to gain any allies.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	we are not, we are actually physically different, have different brain chemistry.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	thus, you should at the very least argue for why nudity should be shown on its own, and not start off by pointing to things you deem  amore distasteful  already being shown.
Comparison of science and religion in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	not for most of history, for most of history scientific progress was connected directly to the religious.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	atheism is not inherently rational or irrational, as the reasons for atheism are varied.
Immorality of not paying taxes.	and if you do not participate fully, you are an immoral person ?	to me the fact that you have likely benefited from tax dollars in each of the life experiences you have described, is an indication that lawful taxation is a good thing.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	in cases where those natural consequences are not experienced by the child who performed the action, it is good and right that a non natural consequence spanking, in this case be implemented by the parent, so that the child can understand that there is a consequence, even if the one their parent imposes is not linked directly to the natural consequence of their action.
Extreme views in atheism and religion.	i feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect.	please cmv that a few unsightly posts on r/atheism are not equal to the evil of suicide bombings or death by stoning for apostasy.
The importance of mandatory writing courses in curriculum.	is there any reason at all to keep these courses in the curriculum, let alone mandatory ?	yeah, english grading will be on the subjective side.
Freedom of speech and the use of the word "oriental"	now i was just wondering why we ca not say the word oriental.	why are their wishes since it more directly impacts their feelings than yours more important than yours ?  oriental  is not associated with a specific thing like slavery that i know of; it is just an archaic term that we used to use in the shitty days where everyone was racist as hell.
Drug use and altering one's state of mind.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	i want to get a new idea because it alters my mind.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	i find myself despising confident people as they speak with pride about things they have never once questioned.
Gender identity and expression.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	they just get surgery/treatment so their body matches.
Views on Hierarchy and Equality in Society	i like hierarchy, and find leadership and social status motivating.	where the system breaks down is that if you are on top one of the most effective ways of getting more value from your money is to make other people poor.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	but how do you know you would not be better, similar, or about anybody else ? you will rarely find an adopted child, even a baby, being breastfed by their adopted parents.
The effects of restricted nudity and internet pornography.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	in your mind, if nudity was more common ? i would argue nothing at all.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	for others, it appeared that the god/s directed their future because they felt powerless in the face of nature, and the fortune and misfortune that rained down upon them.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	the fact they then invaded and occupied half of poland does not dissuade you from this thinking ? what about the fact that hitler only claimed to want the sudetenland from czechoslovakia in , as some germans a minority lived there ? he quite quickly took the rest of czechoslovakia after he would been given the sudetenland.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	we have are pretty good at determining who is conscious based off of brain activity alone.

Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	there are international rules and laws currently in place to prevent things like this happening now, that is about as good as it gets.
Difficulty of Combos and Lack of Advanced Techniques in a Game.	combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there is no l cancelling, wavedashing or other related high level techniques that can be used.	it is just a glitch that casual players have not learned to exploit yet.
The impact of tipping on server wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	that is the point of tips to shift financial risk onto the employees.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	tl:dr/ summary world war ii was inevitable because of the atrocities that occurred almost immediately after germany had taken over poland.
Intelligence and Curiosity in Children and Adults.	but  average  kids outsmart me all the time.	i would claim that in the s/s it is mostly lack of motivation, because you have other stuff to worry about and that it is to some extent even culturally expected to not scrutinize everything.
Tattoos and their significance.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	could not you say exactly the same thing about a painting or a sculpture ? i think you can argue that having  visible ,  loud  tattoos or having a certain, identifiable  style  of tattoo could be fads that may look stupid in a few years, and i would not disagree with you.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	art is a reflection of where we are, science can paint a direction of where we are going.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	while  high quality  is subjective, i think one can safely assume a high quality whiskey sour does not use a neon yellow substance from the well, nor a quality manhattan have cheap vermouth opened a year ago.
Immorality of not paying taxes.	and if you do not participate fully, you are an immoral person ?	i believe you should feel morally obligated to pay taxes, in large part because your success in life would not have happened without others having their wealth redistributed to your benefit.

The influence of colors, images, and words on the human mind.	the human mind is highly susceptible to being influenced by colors, images and words.	but if a person chooses to ignore that, than it is there problem.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	a job is something that you devote a great deal of time to.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	examples like those  implicitly  carry the message that rape and sexual assault are things that a boy can get away with.
Job dissatisfaction and management issues.	my managers overlook how much i help the company and how loyal i am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, i  talk back  too much.	if you are not likable by the other people and departments you depend on, you will not be an effective manager.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	not that it is strictly a medical condition for these people, but some people just plain have it worse than others.
The importance of science in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	good and evil are subjective and relative to the perspective of the person making the labels.

Difficulty of Combos and Lack of Advanced Techniques in a Game.	combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there is no l cancelling, wavedashing or other related high level techniques that can be used.	wavedashing is not a high level technique.
Limitations of Poetry in Subject Matter	i feel poetry fails to combine these two elements diversely, and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	yes, there are very nice and interesting poems that do not fall in between these two spectra, but they are not as well known or as praised.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	the lion  is  blameless.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	if we were emotionless creatures, i would have no problems with casual sex.
Impact of British Empire on Third World and Hitler's Expansion Plans.	but the british empire was the largest and the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	but what about eastward ? it is convenient how you completely ignore the soviet union.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	which would you rather have, a gunfight or a mass shooting ? in a gunfight, at least the defenders have a chance at defending themselves.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	in essence north america was conquered, and the natives were defeated.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	you just  feel that it is wrong  without any real explanations of the consequences.
Testing humans and reliance on simulation.	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	if i want to find out whether my friend is reliable enough to feed my cat, i imagine what i think he will do, running a rough simulation of him in my mind.
Frustration with the American welfare system and desire to play games.	why ca not i just fuck the world and ask for the social welfare payment and play every days some good mmorpg games huh ?	assuming you are american.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	firstly, that is not really the common man is definition of free will current or historical , that is a only a commonly thought  implication  of free will.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	that is the real issue, that those things very often especially on the internet go hand in hand.
Debate on punishment for criminals.	i hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.	in the us, it is a crime that could have more than a  year sentence.
Misconceptions about the LGBTQ+ community.	or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	why do you think this is objectively better this way ? would it be terrible if a woman raised you and you gained difference insights and learned different skills ? just because you happened to be shaped by these experiences how do you know if your life turned out differently without a father how do you know this would be a bad thing ? also, do not you think there is something to be said about you as an individual and what your unique abilities and strengths and weaknesses are ? if you happened to be raised by two mothers how different would you be really ?.
The Thomistic Perspective on Homosexuality and Natural Law.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	and conversely it is equally fallacious to claim that something is bad just because it goes against this assumed purpose.
Animal Extinction and Preservation	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	think evolution will provide us with new ones before you starve to death ? or maybe you will get off easy, and we wo not have total crop failures, and instead food prices will just go up .
Advantages of Neutral and Fixed Money.	in particular, i see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.	why would not the banking system just continue to adapt until all money is processed digitally ? do you know what happens if you lose your wallet ? the bitcoins are gone forever.
Gender identity and transition options.	i feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the  i feel like i should have been male/female  argument.	say you wake up tomorrow, go to your bathroom and a woman is face is looking back at you.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	you are wrong on many levels and many ways, and my original reply was simply in excess of the word length.
Concealed Handguns and their Necessity.	even if you have a concealed handgun, there still really is not a reason for it.	dumb people make me uncomfortable.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	b what you do now has no effect on what happens after death.
Limiting voting rights to educated individuals.	not allowing uneducated people to vote would also reduce the influence of racism and other popular yet often incorrect opinions.	you only did the research because you were required to as part of your class.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	there is more to life than money health, love, knowledge , but money is still a pretty big factor.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	this is akin to the popularity of the roman baths or stonehenge in england: landmarks created by a culture no longer dominant but still admired.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	having money can never compare to having people that love you.
Comparing effects of cannabis and alcohol use.	cannabis also mellows you out, makes you more relaxed and heightens the imagination and improves creativity.	that is just what i experienced though i think children should definitely learn that stuff like that can happen as a result of cannabis use.
The importance of mandatory writing courses in curriculum.	is there any reason at all to keep these courses in the curriculum, let alone mandatory ?	you may not think so now but look back on your writing after a few years or so.
Job satisfaction and career aspirations.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	but i guess if that is what they want, they should pursue it.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	 there are many different dialects and accents in english.
Raising the driving age and preventing texting while driving.	i think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	you are making a lot of generalizations.
Disadvantages of gas-powered vehicles.	crappy gas powered cars and trucks until the dinosaur juice runs out and/or the earth just flat out explodes, whichever comes first.	mining the toxic metals that make up suitable batteries have a huge impact environmentally.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	he is the rightful heir.
Physical effects of injury.	that is because the effects on the body can be physically scarring.	torture.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	if, what you do not like, is this that this group is able to make decisions you do not agree with then you have a problem with democracy.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	and people would have to live in enclosed buildings and not go outside most of the time, or live only in places like tibet or the arctic.
The effectiveness of moral methods in helping people.	using moral means/methods to  cleanse/cure  these people is just a joke.	they still have rights.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	besides, the kind of person who enjoys risk taking like the thrill of unknown partners will likely be attracted to other forms of risk taking regardless, even if they stop indulging in casual sex, simply because they enjoy risk taking.
Racism and Stereotyping.	if you cross the street based purely on race that would be racist.	you may not consider black people  inherently  inferior, but you may consider a random black person on the street more likely to be violent.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	this is not supported by the statistics i have seen.
Debate on the role of evidence in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	what  you  experience is the first hand source material  for you  that trumps all other sources.
The importance of mandatory writing courses in curriculum.	is there any reason at all to keep these courses in the curriculum, let alone mandatory ?	doing so would be simply throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	what that meant is congress could not regulate quickly enough to keep up with inflation.
The importance of mandatory writing courses in curriculum.	is there any reason at all to keep these courses in the curriculum, let alone mandatory ?	this makes the mark completely dependent on the teacher is mood rather that the student is performance.
Paternity leave and feminism in the labor market.	paternity leave increase in the cost of labor market rigidity unemployment.	it is one of the best ways for society to equalize the hiring and pay gap.
Minimum standards for basic needs and freedom to pursue goals.	minimum standards which no one is allowed to go below would be desirable imo, such as access to sanitation, nutritional needs met, basic health care, education and so forth.	and you can be free to pursue that within reason.
Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	the reason is very simple and straightforward: women suck at chess.
Restaurant tipping policy.	i think the main issue i have is that servers pool their tips usually, so a bad server will still get an equal cut of the money compared to the best server there.	i have never waited in a restaurant where that was the case.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	i would not say never, but i would imagine it is so rare as to be non consequential.
Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	it can cost $ just to move a single person from coast to coast.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	and if they ca not, they better find someone to willingly pay for them.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	casting techniques were developed because we wanted to make more complicated forms.
Prescription Refill Reminder	what if you did not realize you were out of refills ?	it is not like a bottle of aspirin that multiple people can use and so it is possible to run out of and not know it.

Discussion about a losing war and betrayal of a leader.	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	robb received accusations of kinslaying for having his distant relative rickard karstark executed; killing his own mother would be an absolute abomination.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	this is exactly what we are telling children when we tell them to follow their dreams.
Male understanding of female experience and desire for it.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	so i guess the point here is that, even if you do not believe that someone can truly feel like they were assigned the wrong gender, you should still feel sympathy because these people believe it and have very real, negative experiences because of it.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	and when you are older, you can date older guys.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	but what is wrong with pursuing a career that you actually enjoy ? why ca not a job be both.

Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	atheism itself just says the person does not believe in gods.
Identifying personal strengths.	my strengths lie in literature and english.	if possible, please approach physics with an open mind.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	? then there is the matter of finding work.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	normally good people will do bad things because other people tell them to.
Teenage driving safety and texting while driving.	teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	i think you live in an urban area, as little of these issues occur so badly in the rural area in which i live.
Criticism of libertarianism's impact on poverty and prejudice.	libertarianism leads to more poverty, blocks the prevention of racism and other prejudice, and ensures that poor people have little hope of escaping their plight.	nazism and stalinism were both extremely big government.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it is universal in all humans and covers things such as  murder is bad  and other fundamental aspects of morality.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	thus: real minimum wage fell, hard, that caused unemployment to fall, hard, that increased the amount of money people were able to earn thus causing a positive externality.
Correlation between test scores and preparation methods.	however, there is a very strong correlation between act/sat scores and the amount of time/money put into preparing for them.	however, test taking ability is pretty important in college.
Grades and job preparedness.	students are coddled and are not prepared for when grades do not exist and their jobs are at stake.	are not grades essentially evaluations of performance ? those exist in pretty much every workplace.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	do i trust this person enough to not wear a condom ?.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	other countries lost their colonies as well, but the british empire was the largest and the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.
Debate: Dog vs. Cat as a Household Pet	i believe that when looked at objectively, a dog is a better potential companion in a household as a pet than a cat.	you should definitely keep in mind that no household is the same, and each owner may be looking for different things in a pet.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	basically, just because someone ca not use the basic does not mean they ca not do a really good job at what they do know, and to consider them less of x because of it is silly.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	an atheist might reject the presented evidence, because citing  wouldeath  and  wouldrugs  are really not very compelling or make sense to be honest.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	at the same time, amount of evidence for opposite is too large too be ignored.
The impact of tipping on server wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	if you want to boycott tipping, then only patronize restaurants that do not accept tips and pay their servers a living wage they are rare but they do exist in the us.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	you cannot go into a steak restaurant, eat a steak, then claim they want to steal $ from you.
Inconsistencies in Wolverine's claws in different movies.	you remember at the end of the wolverine when logan loses his metal claws and regrows the cool as fuck bone claws ?	it looks to me like you are just nitpicking things that within a few minutes of googling would have been solved.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	many people would be just to find something they enjoy and to be able to make enough money from it to live comfortably.
Sex as a reward for being a good person.	there is a common idea that for men perhaps for women as well, but moreso for men , sex and love are rewards for being a good person.	i have literally  never  heard the idea that sex is a reward for being a good person.
Marriage as a Reflection of Christ and the Church	i also subscribe to the notion that marriage is meant to be a reflection on christ and the church, that is, a bridegroom christ and a bride the church .	so for the same reason that god can be described as a king and yet we reject monarchy as a form of government, our real world marriages need not reflect the metaphorical marriages of biblical imagery.
Software failures in vehicles.	why the point as software failures, malfunctions or whatever would mean you ca not go anywhere.	also, the reason google is pouring money into this project is because it will make them money.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	the civil rights movement occurred only  years ago, well within living memory of many of our citizens, and the lgbt rights movement is fighting for things that have already been achieved in parts of europe.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	is your disagreement with the manner in which taxes are used even representative of an inherent problem with taxation or is it about something else ? i do not think you need to feel morally obligated to give money to those people.
Debate on punishment for criminals.	i hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.	inmates with longer sentences are more likely to be selected for the survey, if we are taking a random sample  of people currently in prison.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	chopsticks were strongly advocated by the great chinese philosopher confucius  bc.
Naming children after deceased family members.	i am someone who is named after a deceased family member.	having to explain to her that the person i am named for died quite a significantly long time ago every time i talk to her is not very fun and is putting a stain on our relationship.
Disadvantages of gas-powered vehicles.	crappy gas powered cars and trucks until the dinosaur juice runs out and/or the earth just flat out explodes, whichever comes first.	assuming that electric cars are infinitely better because you personally are not burning fossil fuels while driving is careless first order thinking.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	i am monogamous and i would have a few issues with the idea of polyamory if it were ever suggested to me.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	in an era of designer genetics, your kid will be competing against other  star  athletes and will probably just be normal.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	given that most of congress is made up by those of advanced age, i fail to see how anyone can make the argument that the baby boomers had any kind of policy making power in the  is.
The effects of restricted nudity and internet pornography.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	therefore getting exaggerated images of sex and nudity will lead to poor self esteem.
Offensive policies and societal reactions to offense.	i understand finding racial profiling or stop and frisk offensive, policies that actually impact your life that are sanctioned by the state.	there is different weights to different opinions.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	more in self replies.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	that is up to  them.
Views on Hierarchy and Equality in Society	i like hierarchy, and find leadership and social status motivating.	their spending power goes down, and yours goes up.
The impact of animals on human survival.	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	extinction is not supposed to be sudden and wide spread, like it is today.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	the last glacial period was only °c colder than the modern period and most of europe was covered by glaciers and tundra.
Chopsticks and Soup Eating Customs.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	this has literally never been a concern for me or anyone i know, and i am genuinely baffled at it being a concern for someone.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	is this not simply part of the concept of  any  taxation ? it is the manner in which society has operated for a  very  long time.
Opinions on Acting Skill and Roleplaying.	i find bad acting very cringey, and i do not act well so trying out roleplaying/watching other people act badly does not appeal to me.	it is a skill, and like any other skill, practice makes perfect.
Animal exploitation and consent argument.	the only way the consent argument can be strong is if you are arguing from the standpoint we should not exploit animals period.	to bring it back to your point about caring for animals, yes you might need to examine a cow is vagina to provide proper medical care and there is obviously no consent there, which is fine because you are taking care of the cow is health.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	however in the absence of evidence, rejection is the default position.
Philosophy vs Science.	there is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist ca not.	tell me why i am wrong and why your particular definition of  best  is the best one.
Overpaid athletes in professional sports.	for instance, nba players make tens of millions of dollars a year for what ?	they are the main attraction.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	that is what most atheists do.
The cost of being a superpower.	if we were no longer a superpower, we would not have to spend billions of dollars being be the policeman for other countries and trying and often failing to spread democracy elsewhere.	we do not know what will happen when another superpower can force their agenda.
Federal government's control over constitution.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	that is not what the constitution says.
Criticism of the free market and Luxottica's business practices.	that is not how the free market should work.	i bought a pair from target because i do not want to spend $ on oakleys.
Debate over the moral high ground of the South in the Civil War.	i also believe the south had the moral high ground in the war.	no matter what path was taken, there were white men in power that saw their influence diminishing.
Argument for legalizing all crimes to save money.	why not make all crimes legal, then the police do not need to exist and we save all the money !	if they are going to do the drugs, it is better to regulate them so they are safer to use.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	now it is true you may get accustomed to your bike.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	i mean just look at your computer.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	can  you  state what the law is ? if your personal understanding of cause and effect is as per the  newtonian billiard ball  model ? such an understanding contradicts and  outlaws the existence  of not just free will but tiny  quantum objects  and the existence of the  universe  itself ! science  has not  translated what it implicitly understands about causality into formal laws.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	or supporting an organization like wikileaks despite credit cards refusing to allow you to do so.
***Possible topic: The threat of infectious diseases.	we are overdue for a severe plague.	even without airplanes, this connected infrastructure makes for serious problems: in many parts of africa, hiv has spread in part via long distance truck drivers URL note that this is actually to some extent the opposite of what you seem to be worried about: here the presence of infrastructure makes disease spread easier.
Criticism of libertarianism's impact on poverty and prejudice.	libertarianism leads to more poverty, blocks the prevention of racism and other prejudice, and ensures that poor people have little hope of escaping their plight.	to me, it is nearly as hateful and dangerous as nazism or stalinism.
Offensive policies and societal reactions to offense.	i understand finding racial profiling or stop and frisk offensive, policies that actually impact your life that are sanctioned by the state.	you think those who like chocolate ice cream are morons ? then you are making a statement about others, and it gets weighed differently.
Outdated beliefs and animal population control.	the archaic belief in people returning to life, and even the belief that dead would feel insulted if not  properly respected  is outdated and a fallacy.	they only do what they need to survive, and often it has less environmental impact than our actions.
Ethical dilemma of sacrificing one life to save many.	a father is first priority in that situation, is the well being of his daughter.	you do not think they all have families as well ? do not you think that some of their primary reasons for joining the fireflies was to ensure the well being of their families ? i completely understand why joel made the decision he did, but that does not mean i think his decision was the right one.
Beauty pageants and child safety.	from what i have seen, beauty pageants take on a  cutesy  vibe, not a sexual one.	do i think some girls like doing this ? yes.
Chopstick etiquette and usage.	i do realize that chopsticks are more appropriate for a few select foods.	yes, i know how to use chop sticks properly.
Outrage culture and privilege.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	my offense comes from the notion that he ought to not say that.
Participation trophies and their impact on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	cause a lot of kids could just sit around and do nothing.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	he did what he had to do to defeat a rebel, a usurper, a treasonous degenerate.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	with power, often came the responsibility to protect your people.
Trade with countries lacking freedom, justice, and equality.	why should developed countries trade with countries which have a lack of freedom, justice, and equality ?	you cannot make the moral argument selectively.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	i like my waffles and pancakes with peanut butter, and it fucking sucks trying to spread peanut butter on a waffle.

Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	if anyone argues that what ensued after the liberation of nations was worse than colonial rule, they should understand how much a nation changes when a foreign state has decided to  iset up shop.
Freedom of speech and the use of the word "oriental"	now i was just wondering why we ca not say the word oriental.	first amendment of the us constitution allows for freedom of speech in the us.
The effectiveness of moral methods in helping people.	using moral means/methods to  cleanse/cure  these people is just a joke.	the point is that these are possible areas where rehabilitation can find success.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	and i would hazard a guess it is due to the modern scientific age idea that suggested the universe was reducible to a newtonian billiard ball model where causation was  atoms up  and current events could be traced back as caused by previous events.
Testing humans and reliance on simulation.	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	from the simulated friend is perspective i actually made him live through that time and feed or not feed my cat.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	spanking is used to condition children not to perform a certain action, and is effective without an understanding of why that action is unacceptable.

The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	something must be done in order to change that status quo, but without confidence you lack the agency to do make a move.

Challenges of using chopsticks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	think of how much oil is used making plastic cutlery every year usually two pieces, sometimes three, included with every fast food meal.

The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	you either do not have enough information, or the information you have is leading you in a circle.
Limiting voting rights to educated individuals.	not allowing uneducated people to vote would also reduce the influence of racism and other popular yet often incorrect opinions.	but if the majority of citizens want racist/xenophobic policies, who is to say state should not enforce it ? who is the state suppose to represent, everyone or this select few ? spend £, !   also, the poor would be less likely to vote.
The problem of evil in philosophy.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	philosophers refer to this as the  problem of evil.
Criminal disenfranchisement and empathy-based morality in voting rights.	if we can agree that laws are based on commonly accepted standards of morality and that morality is based on empathy, then people who have proven their lack of empathy through their own criminality should  almost by definition  not be given the right to vote.	mentally ill people still have the right to vote.
Advantages of Neutral and Fixed Money.	in particular, i see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.	all of the digital money schemes in the past have failed, and the most successful  digital  currency is the credit card.
Chopstick etiquette and soup slurping.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	when i get pho or japanese soup, they give you a spoon.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	real life incentivizes you just as hard to put your best foot forward.
Uncertainty about future career path.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	not every high school student knows for sure.
Disagreeing with Webster's Dictionary and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.	disagreeing with webster is dictionary and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.	then you fail to grasp the reason for them.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	then the dragons came, as did the new gods, the seven.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	plenty of german soldiers in wwii were good people, but committed atrocities under the nazi regime.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	i am not sure what this means, but i fail to see how beating them is going to solve this issue.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	it is what i said earlier.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	in regards to your edit in the description, definitely it is a relatively valid basis to consider that because you have not chosen to leave it shows that society must be providing something of value in return.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	assault and battery ? everybody in the bar was drunk and it happened in a corner that was dimly lit and you might have gotten that black eye slipping in the bathroom, anyway.
The influence of colors, images, and words on the human mind.	the human mind is highly susceptible to being influenced by colors, images and words.	there product should have nutritional information, and that is enough.
Genetic modification of non-disease traits in children.	but i would go farther to even argue that non disease traits should be altered by parents to give children better outcomes.	this may not be a moral imperative as disease is, but i for one would do it every time.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	you are basically a temporary island of existence in this scenario, so you only care about not harming others in so far that harming others causes unhappiness for you feeling guilty for the rest of your life is not a nice feeling i guess.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	this is, admittedly, a risk, but with correct usage the failure rate of condoms is pretty low.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	i do not think society is chasing equality as an ideal, i think it is chasing equal opportunity as an ideal and those are entirely different goals.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	and the second one is the less talked about one, which is to evaluate students based on there output, so colleges/employers can separate the capable from the not so capable.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	you do not need a bible in chik fil a.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	however, you cannot train anyone to make  all  the classics in an hour.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	i believe you should feel morally obligated to pay taxes, in large part because your success in life would not have happened without others having their wealth redistributed to your benefit.
Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	judges, at least in the state of oklahoma, do not seem to find it to be an issue that warrants the signing of a court order.
Effects of Spanking on Children's Thinking and Behavior	spanking does not encourage critical thinking: child a:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy will hit me  child b:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy explained x will happen.	teen girls have sex, and get pregnant, often not understanding the consequences, yet they are still responsible.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	many christians believe that genesis  is very literal, but that does not mean the earth is , years old as you are assuming.
Same-sex marriages in a life simulation game.	there is a work around that allows same sex marriages, which is to make a male character a female or vise versa.	sure, it is not realistic, but it is, as you say, a  silly handheld game  and we do not necessarily need to stick to reality if that feature is so desired.
Complexity of Evolution vs Creationism.	complex topics like evolution and celestial mechanics would require thousands of years of discovery to even begin to comprehend.	how does evolution or deep time help us understand electronics, or the science of flight, or how biology works today ? if you saw the nye/ham debate, you will remember ham brought forth a number of phd educated creationists who were contributing valuable work to the body of science, unhindered by a lack of belief in evolution.
Poaching vs Hunting: Moral and Ecological Responsibility.	how are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters ?	how are they making money, or are you using a more nebulous definition of  profit ?   what things are they applying to other people, but not themselves ? how is it hypocrisy ?.
Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	agnosticism, uncertainty, or skepticism can all be aspects of atheism.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	yet you claim there is evidence for some god, so why would agnosticism be superior to atheism.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	not for most of history, for most of history scientific progress was connected directly to the religious.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	you could argue that a tie does not provide a definitive conclusion, but after a penalty shootout in soccer there is a clear  winner  and clear  loser.
The lack of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	where in the computer does the desktop come from ? the desktop is not created in a specific chip on the motherboard, its an accumulation of the cpu, ram, hard drive, and video card working together.
Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	you may hate summer in your region which i am guessing is in a temperate region in the northern or southern hemisphere.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	ok, so what ? do you think that is surprising or relevant ? i  but we do not change the climate do not and ca not are two different things.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	nurture, i believe plays the biggest role in becoming gay.
Fantasy character interactions and offspring.	if two of the characters get married, i want to see the ridiculous offspring of my roommate and jennifer lawrence for example.	for example, i ca not marry mii versions of joseph stalin and vladimir lenin, which is a damn shame.
Frustration with the American welfare system and desire to play games.	why ca not i just fuck the world and ask for the social welfare payment and play every days some good mmorpg games huh ?	any life you will get with government income will be very humble; you will live in low income housing and not be able to afford nice things like bad ass pcs.
Equality and Discrimination.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	we are not, we are actually physically different, have different brain chemistry.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	i agree that you should not mind pirating music, but i disagree with your reasoning:  they are making plenty of money.
Opposing view on the biological basis of homosexuality.	i do not discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.	for instance, even if everyone is born straight, maybe environmental factors are responsible for making people gay at a young age.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	 continue to experience  something.
Uncertainty about future career path.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	until they took the class and became interested.
Participation trophies and their impact on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	but it must stop at some age.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	one of them catered to a more classy clientele, lots of suits and dresses in the bar, and there were lots of those sorts of cocktails.
Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	the small folk do not care who the king is gods are.
Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	why are their wishes since it more directly impacts their feelings than yours more important than yours ?  oriental  is not associated with a specific thing like slavery that i know of; it is just an archaic term that we used to use in the shitty days where everyone was racist as hell.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	this is nonsense, and no different that saying climate change denial is the default position.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	the old bumper sticker slogan goes  in , any englishman could carry a firearm, yet crime was so rare that bobbies rarely carried a gun.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	ages of majority are not about everyone, there are  year olds who are much less emotionally mature than  year olds.
Human fetus and the use of the word "potential".	human fetus is a stage in the life of a human being.	maybe we could find a distinction between human organism and human or human being.
Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	depending on how far you move, there is a cost associated with moving your things.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	for some it appeared that the god/s had given man that freedom, for he was  unlike the other animals  and could build and grow and progress, and succeed or fail based on individual will.
Personal stance on controlled substance use.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	literally everything you experience alters your mind in some way.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	i am not quite sure you know what net neutrality is.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	you do not need to relate to someone to have get sexual intercourse.
Advancement in the Workplace Based on Obedience Rather Than Intelligence.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	it is a tactic for getting the most out of an establishment because it works.
Naming children after deceased family members.	i am someone who is named after a deceased family member.	chances are this would happen anyway.
Federal government's control over constitution.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	a stock market crash in new york will not just make new york destitute, but every place that does business in or with new york, which is most of the world and the entirety of the us.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	two mothers could not have nearly that kind of impact on me.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	bullies are bullies, they will always find a reason to do what they need to do.
Challenges of using chopsticks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	while i do not want to be horribly ethnocentric, and i know etiquette is a cultural construct, i find that practice to be absolutely revolting.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	i do not think i have ever seen any employees told an irate customer to go fuck themselves and gtfo the store while i have seen even managers get chewed up by dipshit customers and just taking it like a little bitch.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	ask them to do trig/calc and they may have no idea how to do it.
Testing humans and reliance on simulation.	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	if i imagined a perfect simulation of what he would do, i would know for sure what he would do but the perfect simulation would be indistinguishable from him.
Poaching vs Hunting: Moral and Ecological Responsibility.	how are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters ?	they kill the wrong species, and/or too many animals.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	rape is not unique because it happens in  private.
Negotiating fair payment for services/goods.	the service/goods someone is providing exceeds the value of x dollars the buyer is offering.	this is the democracy you live in.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	it occurs when you try to analyse something repeatedly, but with no additional information.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	i can disagree with them while not providing alternatives.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	test grades alone will not get you good grades in most high schools.
Benefits of Vaccinations Outweigh Risks	the evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.	because their anti vaccination stance presents a risk to themselves via contracting disease or others either via spreading disease, or preventing their children from being vaccinated , then this is grounds for involuntary admission and treatment in a psychiatric facility.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	rejection of a claim is the default position, by way of something called the null hypothesis URL in the case of climate change there exists evidence that supports the claim, thus further denial is absurd.
Theodicy and the problem of evil.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	but that  yet  makes no logical connection to your previous sentence.
Sexual exclusivity in trust agreement.	why is sexual exclusivity part of the general trust agreeement ?	i do not feel like getting a dna test should be necessary to know that.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	your ability to learn and be edified, i feel, is directly hindered by self confidence.
Atheism as a belief or doctrine.	c the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	for clarification, when someone is asked  do you believe in god  and they say  no , you would:  describe him as  atheist , as per the merriam webster definition a: a disbelief in the existence of deity  describe him as  irrational , because admitting  certainty  is an  unreasonable  response to lack of data is this the crux of your position ? assuming this is what you mean, then i would argue that uncertainty/certainty need not merely be a response to  data  it is also a response to  logic.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	post a profile as a woman on okcupid you will quickly see why many guys are having trouble attracting women.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	you should use them without guilt.
Implications of the US government's actions on an individual.	with all of the world watching, how could the us government do anything to him ?	would not this simply mean the country goes into revolt, with much support from the rest of the world ? disagree with his sentence ? maybe.
Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	i understand that transgendered people wish for societal acceptance want want their voices heard, but co opting the gay platform is a cheap and selfish way to accomplish this.
The depletion of fuel for planes.	planes need fuel, literally tons of it, simply to function.	maybe by that time we will have perfected nuclear power to the point that each plane can have its own little reactor.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	the first one is the obvious one, to educate.
Intelligence and Curiosity in Children and Adults.	but  average  kids outsmart me all the time.	let there be a complicated logic puzzle that a person can solve in their adulthood in   hours.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	people who would resort to shooting others would achieve nothing in preventing genetic extinction.
Same-sex marriages in a life simulation game.	there is a work around that allows same sex marriages, which is to make a male character a female or vise versa.	i have not played the game myself, so i will take your word for it, but even if that is true it is besides the point.
Paternity leave and feminism in the labor market.	paternity leave increase in the cost of labor market rigidity unemployment.	by equalizing that worry across the workforce, you combat pay and hiring inequality.
The effectiveness of moral methods in helping people.	using moral means/methods to  cleanse/cure  these people is just a joke.	the point is not that any of these things are excuses.
Tipping and servers' wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	if i was going hungry, and someone who was being tipped made more than me every week, but was still complaining about making less than everyone, when they clearly did not, i ca not say i would take very kindly to it.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	the leader was not performing the needs of the people so, much like eddard did, roose decided to remove a mad king.
Identity and the effects of drugs/alcohol on perception.	i have observed that while high/drunk users exhibit and/or report that their emotions, perceptions, thought processes, behavior, and memory are altered, if only temporarily.	does that mean you do not value your self too ? i would think not.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	right, you recognize a pattern, but do you believe in zeus ? not, do you believe that zeus is some sort of mythological theme that exists and might be shared among many human cultures.
Job satisfaction and career aspirations.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	it is to be a wealthy artist.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	decades ago that would have been accurate, but today direct music sales are a pretty small chunk of the overall revenue.
Chopstick etiquette and soup slurping.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	yes, i know how to use chop sticks properly.
Animal exploitation and consent argument.	the only way the consent argument can be strong is if you are arguing from the standpoint we should not exploit animals period.	in the case of the former there are arguments to be made that we can ethically ignore the lack of consent, in the latter not so much.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	many of the differences are also environmental rather than genetic.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	but if you asked for another cocktail, it was a bit of a crapshoot on if they would know it or not.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	poland would have given up the path to the sea if britain did not give them the war guarantee.
Chopsticks and Soup Eating Customs.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	either that or you have forgive me, i do not mean this disparagingly very weak grip strength.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	so whether you care about being a music  thief  or not, the industry will find ways to deal with people like you hopefully ways that do not involve million dollar lawsuits.
Alternative treatments for gender dysphoria.	fix your dysphoria without going through a potentially disastrous and expensive series of surgeries etc.	fitting in is becoming less and less of a problem every day for gay people.
Testing humans and God's omniscience in "Men in Black".	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	since you have free will, your life is always made of choices, and will end up different through each choice you make.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	renly was like robert, and robert was a bad king.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	suicide can be selfish in the sense that a person may only be thinking of themselves.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	why would they have built the german equivalent of the maginot line the westwall if he intended to invade westward ? hitler did not want a war with britain, france, or the usa.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	the same goes for homosexual relationships.
Paid paternity leave and funding for early childhood development.	rather than have the market have to take the cost of new fathers, we should have a transfer of funds to early childhood development and new parenting aid.	rather than have walmart pay its workers enough to live off of, we the people are paying for those workers instead.
Marriage as a Reflection of Christ and the Church	i also subscribe to the notion that marriage is meant to be a reflection on christ and the church, that is, a bridegroom christ and a bride the church .	but while these metaphors were/are meaningful, they do not require us to actually and especially not exclusively believe in the imagery that the metaphor employs.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	arguably, you have more of a say in this group than others because you have money and own a business.
Smoking and societal attitudes towards it.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	but i know so many people who smoke, and they all seem fine to me.
Genetic modification of non-disease traits in children.	but i would go farther to even argue that non disease traits should be altered by parents to give children better outcomes.	so why assume that my kids would ? that is good for you, but much like people who ignore global warming, the problem does not disappear because you do not understand it.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	as such it falls into the gender being culturally defined thing.
Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	i wonder if they know that trans people have been by our side fighting our fights for gay equality.
Immigration and US Economy	why ca not we shuffle around illegal immigrants into other developed countries in order to lessen the strain on the us economy ?	there is barely any consensus to help refugees, let alone expand it further.
Grades and job preparedness.	students are coddled and are not prepared for when grades do not exist and their jobs are at stake.	or perhaps educators have improved curriculum with their increased understanding of learning techniques, causing students to just perform better.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	they have a competition where all of the teams are more or less on equal footing , and  the united states sends a team of scrubs who are basically there to get waled on.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	people nowadays rely on internet access to do their jobs, find new jobs, do homework and other schoolwork, etc.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	the bartenders  absolutely  knew that a martini with either gin or vodka has vermouth as an ingredient, but a lot of people in the bar apparently did not like vermouth but were ignorant that it was part of a vodka martini, to the point that the manager told his bar staff to ask for every martini.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	who is it that women like ? is it /r/cillianmurphy /r/chrishemsworth /r/martinfreeman /r/johnnydepp /r/leonardodicaprio these guys all have way different faces and body types, yet they are popular.
Uncertainty about future career path.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	the point of requiring these classes is to expose kids to new things.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	my first reason is that alcohol is still illegal to buy when you are , meaning that when you are learning to drive at the age of  you are still in high school, and while there is the temptation of of buying alcohol, obtaining it is much more difficult than in a couple of years at  when buying alcohol is legal, or i guess  if you are in the us.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	there are movies and books detailing every second of that moment  because  we ca not forget.
Trend of best-selling Wii games for casual players.	if you analyze the list of best selling games on the wii including wii sports, mario kart wii, wii sports resort, new super mario bros.	without a highly competitive game there is a decent marketshare that wo not come to the system at all.
Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	then the dragons came, as did the new gods, the seven.
Controversy surrounding the use of the word "redskin"	first off when has anyone every heard the word redskin outside of talking about the professional football team ?	his mother was a half breed creek, with all the propensities of the redskins to fire water and  itching palms.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	if you have methods or practices that pertain to outside of the good ol  usa that could serve in transforming the system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	do not you care about this at all ? and of course, it is comparatively very easy for us to act now and do something.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	what matters is our social understanding of what these things mean and how they can be used.
Fear of death and afterlife beliefs.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	there is no proof of this.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	it really is the soul of investment.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	self defense ? i once served on a jury where the case came down to just how completely someone had to fill a doorway to count as  blocking  an escape.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	i do not follow the logic.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	this seems to be a worldwide problem, not just for gotham.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	this is the nature of social interaction.
Chopsticks and their practicality.	but for practically everything else, there is just no god damn reason to use chopsticks when western utensils are more practical, and better for the environment.	while i do not want to be horribly ethnocentric, and i know etiquette is a cultural construct, i find that practice to be absolutely revolting.
The Thomistic Perspective on Homosexuality and Natural Law.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	consequently, they can have their own specific purpose, like bonding between two persons who love each other.
Introverts' discomfort with extroverts' questioning.	i have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being  forced to talk  by being asked questions.	similarly, sometimes the most extreme extrovert will wish to be alone with their thoughts, they just ca not stay there without starting to feel very lonely.

Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	there is no point expecting corporations as awful as the us ones to do the ethical and profitable thing for the country, not the company without either forcing them or rewarding them or a combination of the two.
Parental Influence and Gender Roles.	similarly, two fathers ca not breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods.	and teaching a girl about a period ? why not ? is it impossible for a man to have any information or knowledge about the process ? i guess all the male gynecologists and obstetricians do not exist in your world.
Same-sex marriages in a life simulation game.	there is a work around that allows same sex marriages, which is to make a male character a female or vise versa.	you are not restricted whatsoever to physical appearance, which allows quasi same sex relationships.

Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	we accept that we were conquered and shit on, but we also realize that resentment and false dichotomies like you want your view changed about do not help improve mother earth or humanity as a whole.

Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	yes, you could train someone to make three random classic mixed drinks in an hour.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	they are chapters in a visual novel.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	both sentient life and conscious life would be very badly impacted by lack of action, causing a lot of suffering and then death.

Opinions on tattoos as a superficial trend.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	anecdotally, i have met many people whose tattoos hold deep meanings for them.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	as a caveat, i cannot speak to the effectiveness of education outside of the united states.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	i am sure it is very hard to quit, but it does not usually involve major changes in your behavior that may not even be compatible with how you want to live many obese people are obese because they have no time to exercise and not enough money for healthy food.

Affirmative action and merit-based scholarships.	i believe that all scholarships should be merit based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill  race quotas  to  diversify the campus  in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.	would you support preferential treatment of poorer applicants, or do you think it should be only about their qualification ? if you do support it, how would you propose to measure a person is wealth ?.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	you will get older and start worrying about lung cancer and other lung diseases.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	it is because of the government that many people actually have phone service instead of being written off as unprofitable.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	the key is finding the balance.
Trend of best-selling Wii games for casual players.	if you analyze the list of best selling games on the wii including wii sports, mario kart wii, wii sports resort, new super mario bros.	since it is nintendo themselves that put out both the game and the console sometimes it is worth sacrificing a bit of the sales of the game to stimulate the entire console.

Controversy over young girls wearing suggestive clothing.	worst is their parent has no issues with it.	is this extremely different than a young girl in a bikini ? is this  more  inappropriate than that ? do you also have a problem with a  y/o girl wearing a swimsuit ? are you certain they have no problem with it ? they may have problems with it but at a certain point, you are not going to ground a  or  year old indefinitely because they are wearing something that, although may be suggestive, is not  overtly  sexual or inappropriate.
Gender identity and transition options.	i feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the  i feel like i should have been male/female  argument.	that is only one of the many issues, most people start with hormone replacement therapy, then surgery following a long time in hrt, there are even those who elect not to undergo surgery.

Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	robert may not have been obsessed with justice, but see what kind of a ruler he was ? you could argue his inbility to maintain relationships  is  a problem, and i would agree, but i do not think that is a disqualifier and it is inaccurate to say he cannot maintain a relationship with  anyone.

Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	regardless, no relationship is ever pointless whether it is your friends, family, or significant others.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	your future.
Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	i have been a gym rat most of my life but i have a friend who shed about  pounds and she is downright merciless on herself in a way i have never experienced because she lost the weight and frets all the time about  keeping it off.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	if you propose a god that operates in accordance with natural law, you ca not prove anything but natural law.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	that instance was probably the largest factor in your view that being gay is a choice because you were told that homosexuality is wrong and not holy/natural, therefore it is your nurtured understanding that the only explanation for being gay is simple human decision to break from the  natural norm.
Transgender struggle and its comparison to other minority struggles.	i do not think the trans struggle is on the same level as that of homosexuals and racial minorities.	society might be getting less homophobic than it used to be, but it is still very transphobic.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	i turned him down because i was not really looking for a relationship and even if i was, i did not know him or anything about him.
Criticism of a writer's skills and downvotes.	and for having a lot of discussion, what is up with the pile of downvotes ?	he may tell a good story, but he is not a great writer, and not a literary genius.
Eliminating the use of the word "potential" in reference to humans.	as a last point, what else, if not a human ?	there is absolutely no reason to use the word potential.
Evaluation of Robert's Leadership Qualities.	and suffers from massive reality distortion field which gets him into fights he cannot win.	period.
Misconceptions about Science and Evolution.	humanity is understanding of science, particularly of biology and physics, are hopelessly incorrect on almost every level.	evolution has been artificially overlaid over science, you could eliminate it altogether and have no less understanding of biology or physics.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	it is not a complicated of a thing.
Government's role in contract enforcement.	so why would the government want to ease your financial life when you fall deeply in love with someone else ?	yes, they do exist at the government is behest.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	today, modern poetry, is where art and aesthetics meets the word.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	weather paterns would change considerably and great many people would have to migrate.
Misinterpretation of the phrase "I do not care"	even here, i would argue that the narrator does actually care about the consequences of her actions just not the consequences that most people would be thinking about when their car is totaled.	that is true of most of the song, but not necessarily the refrain.
Existence of God and its worthiness of admiration.	i can only conclude that there either is no god, or that there is a god not worthy of admiration and praise.	disclaimer: i am agnostic, i am kind of playing devils advocate here.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	atheists are merely waiting to be convinced of god is existence.
Comparison of science and religion in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	religion has been one of the primary driving forces behind societies for most of human history.
Equality and Discrimination.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	as long as everyone can meet the requirements, there is not a valid reason for discrimination.
Debate on the definition of atheism.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	i consider empirical evidence to be evidence, your skepticism notwithstanding.
Zero tolerance policy in schools	i also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who ca not solve problems on their own.	teaching kids that violence in society has significant consequences is logical and practical, because assault is illegal.
Bad decision making and quitting smoking.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	campaigns against body shaming  would be equivalent to  do not hate on people who are bald from the chemo for their lung cancer  this comparison is very exaggerate, but i hope you get what i mean.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	it was inevitable with the digital age.
Existence of God and its worthiness of admiration.	i can only conclude that there either is no god, or that there is a god not worthy of admiration and praise.	if you read the book of genesis, you will see that he even performed some of these things noah is ark anyone ? there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	chinese people, under the cultivation of confucianism, consider the knife and fork bearing sort of violence, like cold weapons.
Patriarchy in Western Society	patriarchy is a simple term describing a society in which fathers are the heads of families, men are the heads of tribes and governments, etc; descent is traced through the male line; and so forth.	the patriarchy  as it really exists, particularly in feminist circles, is what you describe in your first paragraph.
Causes of WWII and Lebensraum concept.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	hitler is  explicit  goal was to carve up eastern europe into a colonial empire, to turn germany into a self sufficient superpower that could go toe to toe against france, britain and specially the us.
Criticism of a writer's skills and downvotes.	and for having a lot of discussion, what is up with the pile of downvotes ?	cmv ! but there is nothing that prevents an illiterate man from being a great storyteller.
Philosophy vs Science.	there is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist ca not.	actually, i would say the best students are those that engage in interdisciplinary studies.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	now we have a new race of rich people with better genes, and normal people with normal genes.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	lack of confidence and constant affirmation slows things down considerably to the point where often nothing gets done or the task becomes too tedious.
Taxation and Wealth Redistribution for Large Corporations.	firstly, higher tax rates for large corporations would redistribute wealth in society, without greatly affecting the rich individuals in question.	what about the small groups of rebels who wage guerilla war on a region ? there is no point is trying to seed small business when there is so much instability.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	children growing up in, say, creationist homes or muslim faith schools will be simply scientifically illiterate when they reach adulthood, preventing thousands of possible scientists and engineers from ever progressing.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	this seems to be suggesting that a massively profitable company will not be incentivised to hire people if there are tax cuts.
The reality of military service.	so, with that wrapped up, i figure i can spice up my life a little. some adventure, no ?	but if they want you to go to the desert and load cargo onto planes for five years, that is what you do.
Importance of Proper Communication in Job Interviews	i am pretty sure i could not have even gotten an interview if i spoke like lil  montrell up the street haha.	actual black culture is just that, a culture.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	the issue is there is a lot of variation within the sexes even if some of these things are true.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	but you can also get a good feeling from being a  good person.
Gender Quality in Two Nations.	let is say nation a has men who have more superior qualities mentioned above than nation b, but fewer women of high quality.	fortunately intelligent people tend to mate with other intelligent people.
Inconsistencies in Wolverine's claws in different movies.	you remember at the end of the wolverine when logan loses his metal claws and regrows the cool as fuck bone claws ?	well this film does not, he has his metal claws in the future with no reason given, at all ! the worst part is that in the past he has the bone claws ! this is your complaint ? wolverine is bone claws from his second spin off ? i mean, what did you want a line from magneto like  good thing i gave you your claws back.
The deception of Santa Claus.	there is a real feeling that you have been lied to, because well you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.	how would christmas morning feel when you would know that your presents have been hidden in the closet for a week ?.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	i think it has something to do the endless and the abnegation by destruction of his duties.
Limiting voting rights to educated individuals.	not allowing uneducated people to vote would also reduce the influence of racism and other popular yet often incorrect opinions.	no one does that amount of research on issues.
The meaning of "God" in the context of religion.	change my view that god should represent the shared human concept of existence for people who claim to be religious, as anything less thought out than that basically implies that the word  god  has no more meaning within the framework of our reality.	instead, you should simply come up with your own term.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	robert was a likeable guy, and how did he do ? it is not a reality distortion, it is an acceptance of reality.
Philosophy and Science's Relationship.	many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.	tell me why i am wrong and why your particular definition of  best  is the best one.
Opposing view on the biological basis of homosexuality.	i do not discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.	okay, this is not really related to the heart of your cmv, but i disagree that the  fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights  necessarily assume that being gay is not a choice.
Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	giving companies monies from the public purse with no accountability for it is a recipe for failure if you give money that has to be contingent on deliverables imo.
Physical effects of injury.	that is because the effects on the body can be physically scarring.	i have seen videos, i have read testimonials.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	i think here is an appropriate time to contend one of your points.
Comparison of chopsticks and forks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	because a fork is designed to pierce the food, it is suboptimal in the following respects:   it compromises the structural integrity of delicate foods by mashing them against your plate.
Government's role in contract enforcement.	so why would the government want to ease your financial life when you fall deeply in love with someone else ?	why ? to make the wheels of interactivity turn a little easier.
Comparison of eating habits between smokers and non-smokers.	i think the difference is mostly visceral, and stems from the fact that eating food is viewed by most as pleasurable whereas a non smoker is unable to understand the craving of a smoker.	while eaters can temporarily replace eating with other habits, there is nothing they can use to permanently replace eating.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	but it is not good for money to be the only thing you care about.
Immigration and US Economy	why ca not we shuffle around illegal immigrants into other developed countries in order to lessen the strain on the us economy ?	this is false.
Sexual exclusivity in trust agreement.	why is sexual exclusivity part of the general trust agreeement ?	because, in the case of my so and i, we wanted monogamy to be a part of that.
Federal government's power and control over minimum wage.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	marriage equality ? back to pursuit of happiness, with the added responsibility of interstate action.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	once you get exposed to ideas, then you can consider people as  believing  specific ideas are wrong.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	there are, in fact, just as many advertisments on swedish websites and roads.
Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	i like to fish, and not on top of ice.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	it is grokked from drangle and dougle through the process of xarckle.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	if a corporation does not want to sell a product or service, who is to make them ? but when a corporation is in a business, where they are using the public right of way, then the public, as a property owner itself, as well as a property right protector, then they have the right to set conditions on it.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	if anything it is their new policy which is unreasonable.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	they have to make their own decisions.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	until it is actually used for its purpose.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	combined with the already low risk of their partner having an std, some may consider it worth it.
Teenage driving safety and texting while driving.	teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	i was  the st time i was in an accident.
Judgment towards drug preferences.	nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring lsd or mdma.	i agree with this.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	the second reason is for most people you are still living with your parents, so there is someone that you are accountable to, as you are likely driving one of their vehicles, and they are also someone to learn from.
Gotham City's Crime and Corruption.	the city is plagued by psychotic villains who steal and kill constantly, who seem to manipulate or break their way out of prison with fearful ease.	but he is driven clinically insane by the injustices he is subjected to.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	you do not need to be someone is best friend, you just need their respect.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	there are many times more lawful carriers than there were  years ago, yet the gun homicide rate is down  since .
Animal exploitation and consent argument.	the only way the consent argument can be strong is if you are arguing from the standpoint we should not exploit animals period.	you do not need to fuck a sheep to survive or to cure cancer, people just do it to get their rocks off and they could just as easily go beat off.
Marriage as a Reflection of Christ and the Church	i also subscribe to the notion that marriage is meant to be a reflection on christ and the church, that is, a bridegroom christ and a bride the church .	for example, god is not really a biological male, a biological father, a political king, etc.
Introverts' discomfort with extroverts' questioning.	i have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being  forced to talk  by being asked questions.	this provides the illusion of a small minority of introverts in an extroverted world, as far as extroverts can see things.
Complexity of Evolution vs Creationism.	complex topics like evolution and celestial mechanics would require thousands of years of discovery to even begin to comprehend.	evolution is not any more difficult to explain than a six day creation, god could have eli the story of change over time.
Importance of Proper Communication in Job Interviews	i am pretty sure i could not have even gotten an interview if i spoke like lil  montrell up the street haha.	if i called a potential candidate and he answered the phone with   isup, nigga ? aw, yea homslice.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	your isp also wants to charge netflix for what you download with the threat of slowing down their netflix traffic.
Criticism of the free market and Luxottica's business practices.	that is not how the free market should work.	when and if they try to raise their prices, a smaller competitor will undercut them.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	using the us dollar is a choice you make.
Baker refusing to make cake for polygamous marriage.	what if a baker refused to make a cake for a polygamous marriage ?	we as a people have determined that some of these reasons race, gender, age, and now sexual orientation are not valid because these traits are intrinsic to the person and discriminating on such things is detrimental to society.
Opinions on Wealth Distribution	do you think that no one deserves to experience superwealth ?	while no person is obligated to donate any amount of money, charity is absolutely necessary to maintaining civil society.
Subjectivity of opinions on musicians and people.	there are loads of better musicians and many more interesting people.	secondly, boy bands are successful much more for their looks than their creative talent.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	absolutely true ! the big issue, though, is that a lot of people tend to forget that in relationships things go both ways.
Nudity in Men's Locker Rooms.	which i believe directly leads to people not feeling comfortable in their own naked bodies.	the men is locker room is a nude fest and has been since the ymca in grade school.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	when you are an adult you are doing things all on your own, so not having a trusted adult around to help you along can mean you will learn more bad habits.
Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	having above average intelligence is irrelevant at this point.
Judgment towards drug preferences.	nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring lsd or mdma.	how could rehab centers operate if its patients were in danger of being arrested merely by walking through the doors ? how would you facilitate this ? where does the money come from and how do we take down the drug cartels ? its fine if you do not think people should be able to do drugs but you cant say your solution is prohibition but i know i guy who can get me some pot who knows a guy who can get me some acid who knows a guy who can get me some meth.
Zero tolerance policy in schools	i also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who ca not solve problems on their own.	these people are not going to learn to defend themselves, nor should they be required to.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	the fatigue part is really the key point as to why they cannot play into infinity.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	well, you are just flat out wrong there, a little conversation with vint cerf if you are going to discuss the internet you should know who he is shows that government gets the credit URL the credit for the internet and tcp/ip which runs it goes to vint cerf and bob kahn working in the arpa project which was funded and run by the government.
The correlation between slut-shaming and rape.	my comeback is always,  why put yourself in that position .	also there has never been a study done, that i know of, that showed a good correlation between  slutieness  and getting raped.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	there is not a universal taboo against homosexuality, and i will cover the other arguments against it below.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	struggle is a part of school that most people have to deal with.
Cultural disintegration in a globalized world.	with the world becoming more and more of a melting pot, cultures seem to be disintegrating.	cultures change from both internal like technology and external forces like migration.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	we do hold science as the answer because it has an amazing track record.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	this is unsound because unrealistic ideas on attractiveness are everywhere, not just in porn movies, advertisements, etc.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	democrats fucked up too, and did so often.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	we retell the story so that our children may know what it meant to be able to stand there.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	just so we are clear.
Participation trophies and their impact on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	it does not give kids something to strive for or work towards.
Subjectivity of Monetary Value and Understanding Price Determination Systems.	that is, i think that monetary value is inherently subjective and that we do not usefully understand the systems that determine the price of a good, or an appropriate salary for work performed.	you are correct, we do not fully understand how things are valued, that is why we do not try to control it.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	there is also a strong emotional psychological dependence; this is what leads to relapse after quitting.
Success and Personal Capability	i am defining better here as how well equipped i am to be successful in achieving my goals in life.	by that definition, obviously some people are better than others.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	gnostic atheism is making a specific claim that no god exists.
Debate: Dog vs. Cat as a Household Pet	i believe that when looked at objectively, a dog is a better potential companion in a household as a pet than a cat.	if a pet is better than another because it suites an owners preferences, then it is not objectively superior.
Taxation and Wealth Redistribution for Large Corporations.	firstly, higher tax rates for large corporations would redistribute wealth in society, without greatly affecting the rich individuals in question.	be very careful about creating one ruler to measure poverty and wealth in all places.
Discipline and Spanking in Children's Behavior.	kids these days are unruly and need to be taught discipline !	certainly there are kids for which spanking wo not work.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	in the above example, it was  you  who choose to whether to enhance your capability, or lower your inconvenience.
Discipline of children and spanking as a form of punishment.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	when a reason for spanking is explained, that reason has a much higher chance to  sink in  if accompanied by spanking.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	 million soviet people would still have died because of hitler is desire for lebensraum.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	a strong criticism of something often carries evidence pointing to a contrary mechanism or correlation however its not required for the null hypothesis.
Comparison of regular birth control pills and Plan B.	why should regular daily pill birth control be any different ?	from this factor alone combined with the not my liability / sue everything culture we live in makes it a necessity that individuals who are taking medications that can cause a risk to life or limb should be routinely evaluated by a medical professional.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	and it can lead to the corporation making decisions about where to base certain operations on paying less taxes rather than economic efficiency.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	if that were the case then every company would hire until they were no longer profitable, and there would be no long term profitable companies.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	atheists are merely waiting to be convinced of god is existence.
Comparison of Japan's acknowledgement of genocide and Germany's acknowledgement of the Holocaust.	and the japanese wo not even acknoledge the genocide in the same way germany does with the holocaust, that is just rubbing salt in the wound.	if anything the  salt in the wound  is much less extreme than it was, say,  years ago when it was still a fresh wound.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	i do not think you are making a fair comparison.
Inappropriate clothing and sexualization of girls.	in my opinion these types of shorts reveal way to much.	it is perfectly understandable to want to avoid these feelings of sexual guilt, but is telling girls how to dress really the best course ? when you tell a girl that she ca not wear those shorts because they are too sexual, you are really telling her that she is supposed to be responsible for other people is thoughts.
Poaching vs Hunting: Moral and Ecological Responsibility.	how are poachers more morally and ecologically irresponsible than hunters ?	poachers have no interest in maintaining a healthy population, unlike the groups that set hunting seasons and limits.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	i would recommend smoking meth over tobbaco.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	again it is statistically unlikely.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	they should have worded it such that it only applied to open carriers, not all lawful gun carriers.
Outrage culture and privilege.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	we get offended when people spread embarrassing or untrue information about us.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	there are many scenarios when risk taking is sensible, like making an investment with a potentially massive payoff.
Disagreeing with Webster's Dictionary and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.	disagreeing with webster is dictionary and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.	you are wrong on many levels and many ways, and my original reply was simply in excess of the word length.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	i never understood the animosity between the  stem  coursework and the  arts.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	more deaths have been caused by engineers than by artists.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	 english uses phrasal verbs a lot.
Sharing personal experience as a universal truth.	projecting your experience to everybody is a logical mistake.	at the same time, amount of evidence for opposite is too large too be ignored.
Misconceptions about Science and Evolution.	humanity is understanding of science, particularly of biology and physics, are hopelessly incorrect on almost every level.	not on every level, just evolution and deep time.
Effectiveness of Advertising.	i have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.	so you are inviting people over and want to have a good time with them.
The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	but natural law is not a good ethical argument, as it is application has in other cases been unethical it is been used as a justification of slavery, the subjugation of women, etc.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	because if the god/s knew the future, man was animal only.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	this is just a straw man argument.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	most people who move to a different area do so because they found a good job that suits them there.
Effects of Spanking on Children's Thinking and Behavior	spanking does not encourage critical thinking: child a:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy will hit me  child b:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy explained x will happen.	it escalates into threats.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	robert may not have been obsessed with justice, but see what kind of a ruler he was ? you could argue his inbility to maintain relationships  is  a problem, and i would agree, but i do not think that is a disqualifier and it is inaccurate to say he cannot maintain a relationship with  anyone.
Parental Influence and Gender Roles.	similarly, two fathers ca not breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods.	bullying in school can also happen with the parents being interracial, the parents not being a common religion, or being disabled.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	on line dating provides a pre filter for the people that you do start to spend time with and a quicker way to weed out undesirable through quick conversation.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	anything else is a bonus.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	the major reason however that points as to why you are also in the wrong is the fact that you know she is married.
Comparison of Japan's acknowledgement of genocide and Germany's acknowledgement of the Holocaust.	and the japanese wo not even acknoledge the genocide in the same way germany does with the holocaust, that is just rubbing salt in the wound.	you are going to need much better reasoning than that.
Discussion about a losing war and betrayal of a leader.	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	and thank the gods for it.
Comparison of science and religion in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	children growing up in, say, creationist homes or muslim faith schools will be simply scientifically illiterate when they reach adulthood, preventing thousands of possible scientists and engineers from ever progressing.
Risks and Rewards of Teenage Sex.	however, i feel like the risks of sex as a teenager far outweigh the rewards.	are only effective when used properly and responsibly.
Sex as a reward for being a good person.	there is a common idea that for men perhaps for women as well, but moreso for men , sex and love are rewards for being a good person.	also, king of queens is not a good example either.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	if you had  of these problems and i asked you to solve all of them would you want to ? would not you hate every second of it ? that is how smart students feel when a class does not challenge them.
Risk and uncertainty in life-saving decisions.	so gambling with a person a life without even guaranteeing the safety of others, is even less desirable.	what if he killed all those fireflies, rescued ellie, and then got killed on his way out of the surgery room ? that would make the deaths of all the people he murdered completely pointless.
Obesity and Bad Decision Making.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	very rarely does someone start smoking at age , but there is an entire industry around giving cheap but unhealthy food to  year olds either that or the entire happy meal industry is aimed at bronies or something.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	i actually feel that libertarians may be less selfish than others in some ways.
Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	i do not feel the non drug users are suddenly gonna start doing tons of drugs if they are made legal.
Grades and job preparedness.	students are coddled and are not prepared for when grades do not exist and their jobs are at stake.	of course, a student who receives a grade that indicates greater performance than they actually have will certainly be devastated when a different evaluation gives a more accurate and harsher feedback.
Atheism as Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	people are born lacking a belief in god, and theists are the ones making the claims.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	i came to that conclusion because i think it is the best explanation ever given about why america is a broken country.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	then you are excluding a lot of people who are obese.
Parental Influence and Gender Roles.	similarly, two fathers ca not breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods.	i would not say never, but i would imagine it is so rare as to be non consequential.
Opinions on Wealth Distribution	do you think that no one deserves to experience superwealth ?	if this charity were to disappear, funding for a lot of these services would need to be made up through higher taxes.
Drug use and altering one's state of mind.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	i want to know about this religion because it alters my mind.
Health risks associated with soft drink consumption.	caffeine is an addictive substance, and the high fructose corn syrup that is so common in soft drinks can contribute to many long term health problems including tooth decay, obesity, heart disease, liver failure, and diabetes.	seriously, fructose corn syrup is simply sugar and it is not harmful.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	the claim that ubiquity of religiously is somehow evidence for the validity of those religious claims is inherently contradictory, what about in cases where different religions are in opposition to each others claims.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	you will  not  always enjoy smoking.
Disadvantages of gas-powered vehicles.	crappy gas powered cars and trucks until the dinosaur juice runs out and/or the earth just flat out explodes, whichever comes first.	URL to recap:  minimal  increase in environmental friendliness, and as others have pointed out, no infrastructure recharging stations.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	tldr; i believe that being gay is not always a choice and is heavily influenced by hormones in the womb.
Affirmative action and merit-based scholarships.	i believe that all scholarships should be merit based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill  race quotas  to  diversify the campus  in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.	a good affirmative action policy based on things like race or gender should be temporary and the purpose should not be to level the playing field directly.
Argument for legalizing all crimes to save money.	why not make all crimes legal, then the police do not need to exist and we save all the money !	! people are doing these drugs anyway.
Genetic modification of non-disease traits in children.	but i would go farther to even argue that non disease traits should be altered by parents to give children better outcomes.	that is an awful lot of pressure and expectations to put on a person you have not even met.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	this is nonsense, atheism is lacking a belief in any god.
Ethical dilemma of sacrificing one life to save many.	a father is first priority in that situation, is the well being of his daughter.	firstly, just because he has a fatherly instinct to protect ellie it does not make his decision right.
The path to finding God through trust/faith versus enlightenment.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	but just  trust in the book  is certainly not good enough to prove he does exist.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	atheism is lacking belief in a god, but not claiming that no god exists.
Gender stereotypes in media portrayal of romantic relationships.	women are often portrayed in the media as being very concerned about romantic love and men as commitment phobes more interested in sex.	why not ? it is hard to argue against something if we have no idea why you hold it.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	they are intertwined a bit in that you find people who identify as female all have similar brain structures transwomen have closer brain structure to ciswomen than to cismen and the same goes for those who identify as male.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	there was the religion of the old gods in westeros.
The impact of tipping on server wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	are you familiar with how tips work ? if you do not tip a waiter, you are not harming the employer, you are just harming the waiter.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	humans are insanely bad at looking at the long term costs and weighing it against the short term gain.
Federal government's control and protection.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	misuse of the word inherent.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	life could adapt if it took a hundred thousand years, but not in a century.
Capitalism and its limitations.	for another, competition becomes impractical after a point; try starting an isp, or a car company, or a petrochemical company.	wealth, being variable but finite, must therefore be transferred or kept from someone else in order to get it; therefore, it tends to concentrate.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	he barely survived one siege, but he won.
The reality of military service.	so, with that wrapped up, i figure i can spice up my life a little. some adventure, no ?	have you talked to a lot of vets ? military service is often romanticized, but most people who have been through the military will you that any experience they had that was not permanently traumatizing was pretty boring.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	or do you think google is our supreme lord and master ? those companies are demanding stuff from the public.
Pizza sizes and confusion.	my point is that when places like dominos and pizza hut sell you s, m, l pies, you have no way to know what you are getting.	if you are upset at ordering a  large  pizza for $ and only got a  , the only one at fault is you for blindly assuming how big a large is when the information on how big a pizza hut or dominos large is already available.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	when people decide that they do not follow the ones they do not like society breaks down.
Importance of Proper Communication in Job Interviews	i am pretty sure i could not have even gotten an interview if i spoke like lil  montrell up the street haha.	i am down for some motherfuckin job intervias.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	we have a larger percentage of minorities that we consider to be equally american, our movements towards equal rights are both more recent and ongoing, and we are more concerned with being superficially nice.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	it is not just other people who have to be good enough for you, but you that has to be good enough for  them.
Risks and Rewards of Teenage Sex.	however, i feel like the risks of sex as a teenager far outweigh the rewards.	it just sounds silly.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	how long have they been married ? you say they had two kids together imagine what this could possibly due to their marriage.
Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	at this point, as long as you are not stupid as fuck or do retarded shit which is partly based on how obedient you are , you are already good to go.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	get them driving before they start using these substances and they will likely have a better appreciation for how much harder and dangerous driving would be under the influence.
Reading habits of Reddit users.	most reddit users skim comments at best and do not bother to read low enough or read down voted threads.	essentially it is the self selected survey issue.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	there is no longer class mobility because your genetic disadvantage will make it impossible.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	these aspects are often termed to be  gods  so why exactly should an explicitly  non divine definition of god be used a religious sense ? in other words, you want god to mean  shared concept of existence  but since god is a word that in nearly every instance invokes divine or transdivine sentiments, why should it apply to something like existence or the world around us ?.
Opinions on tattoos as a superficial trend.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	their beef seems to be that tattoos are suddenly popular and are a superficial aesthetic fad that will be seen as dated and embarrassing in the future, not that they have lost their meaning.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	a doctor earns their title, a duke does not.
Dressing conservatively to reduce chances of unwanted attention.	but i think if you dress like a whore you increase your chances.	also there has never been a study done, that i know of, that showed a good correlation between  slutieness  and getting raped.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	hitler still wanted war with the east.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	and should it reach a point where action is necessary, act.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	i am not morally wrong for ending someone is life because they made the decision to end it.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	most of the tax revenue the federal government would lose in a tax cut would be going to companies like this that do not actually need it.
The difficulty of winning the war against terrorism.	we could literally blow up every remaining terrorist, and we still would have lost the war.	a force that killed a close relative.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	however, declensions are concrete and you only need to follow a fixed pattern, whereas definite/indefinite articles only have a general pattern and still need to be  felt  out.
The challenges of relationships and breakups.	not to mention becoming emotionally compromised if a break up were to occur.	you die.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	to me the fact that you have likely benefited from tax dollars in each of the life experiences you have described, is an indication that lawful taxation is a good thing.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	a gun allows for the proper escalation of force with less risk to the user.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	that does not mean that they should be  given  a sexual partner just to keep their cool.
Government's role in marriage.	which made me ask, why the government was even involved in marriage in the first place.	because contract enforcements are a business of the government.
Affirmative action and merit-based scholarships.	i believe that all scholarships should be merit based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill  race quotas  to  diversify the campus  in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.	if you know people with certain traits yourself, your expectations wo not be solely shaped by prejudice.
Chopstick etiquette and soup slurping.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	if i am in a very asian restaurant, perhaps in k town, i drink out of the bowl.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	it may very well be that you have a gap in knowledge related to your educational background, and i ca not speak for the educational establishment of the us as a whole, but native american culture continues to have a rich influence on modern life.
Parenting strategies.	the actual difficulty just comes from figuring out what kind of strategy you want to utilize to raise your kid.	there is never a singular strategy that applies to every situation or every kid.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	that does not necessarily make them the best pet.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	teach boys not to rape  is not there because otherwise, grown from a petri dish in an isolated environment, boys will definitely turn into rape fiends it is because if we do not explicitly address it, the existing cultural message is ambiguous on the issue at best and rape friendly at worst.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	maybe i am just angry for being yelled at for holding the door for a random chick but seriously, what is so wrong with different treatment, as long as it is short of malicious discrimination ? people are not the same, but like i said variation within the sexes is at least if not greater.
Theoretical limits of modeling particles in the universe.	theoretically speaking, if methuselah lived long enough and had enough clay tablets he could perform all of the calculations necessary to model all of the particles in the universe.	if i take the written code for mario brothers and print it on paper, it will just sit there.
Opinions on Donald Trump's wife, Melania.	but more importantly she does not appear like gold digger, she feels she earned everything with work.	i am only trying to change your view that you do not believe she appears to be a gold digger.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	build a roof.
Animal exploitation and consent argument.	the only way the consent argument can be strong is if you are arguing from the standpoint we should not exploit animals period.	there are shades of grey that you are not acknowledging here though.
The purpose of education.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	the pride you feel when you accomplish something difficult, is much more valuable.
Hunting and its impact on wildlife conservation.	hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence.	hunters, just like poachers, threaten animal for the sake of profit.
Opposing view on the biological basis of homosexuality.	i do not discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.	 gay marriage is not harmful in any way.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	but other than those actual biological sexual characteristics, the traits we commonly associate as masculine and feminine are entirely cultural when it comes to pointing out the differences between men and women.
Animal Extinction and Preservation	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	there is no reason to panic over animal extinctions, there is no tangible benefit to preserving animal species.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	i concur with this ideal.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	i also believe that this is reprehensible.
Opposing view on the biological basis of homosexuality.	i do not discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.	one argument for gay marriage might go like this:  unless gay marriage is harmful in some way, it should be allowed.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	if you are stuck in the corporeal world, you must deal with the realities of that.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	as for any  loop holes  well those are our fault, if they are a problem we will work to close them.
***Topic: The irrationality of atheism.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	there is so much evidence of god that i cannot begin to list it all, but i did mention some in my op.
Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	here is URL an article about rape rates in the us.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	that is going to reflect one of the problems with a discussion of a fictional entity which has many interpretations.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	i think that there is no such thing as overthinking, and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.
Views on Hierarchy and Equality in Society	i like hierarchy, and find leadership and social status motivating.	and you can be free to pursue that within reason.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	everyone does unproductive things because they enjoy them, are you opposed to all of that too ? and it is perfectly possible to indulge in casual sex without developing bad habits.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	modern taxation in the us if far from a group of people collecting money for their own personal gain.
Outrage culture and privilege.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	stereotyping muslims has lead to a great deal of discrimination.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	the us is very much committed to soccer as a sport, and has a decent soccer team that performs decently on the world stage.
Debate on punishment for criminals.	i hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.	we are debating whether people convicted of a felony should have a right to vote.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	you ca not win an argument by holding up one definition of one dictionary and use this as the single, defining way a word must be interpreted.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	pancakes are also superior in that they do not require their own kitchen appliance to make that is just going to take up more cabinet space, until you get the wild hair up your ass  or  times a year to drag the motherfucker out.
The influence of corporations on government.	due to actions like this, i think that the government of any particular country has to not allow a large business to alter the position of the government in any way, shape, or form.	should  guys like is suggested by /u/mckoijion not have the right to call their representatives ? also, while corporate lobbying is huge, groups like the aarp, the nra, and unions lobby just as hard if not more.
Empirical verification of God's existence through various methods.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	for example some define god as the ultimate reality URL and others define god as love URL.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	any view on how to live your life really comes down to how you view the nature of existence and reality.
Evidence of God's existence through various means.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	evidence of god is frequently achieved be it via ecstatic spiritual experience or logic, innate knowledge or etc , and is likely replicable via proper experimentation a life of prayer and contemplation, love for god   neighbor, yoga / meditation, entheogens, nde is and death, for instance.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	tl;dr  you are definitions are wrong, and from that many of your positions are wrong.
Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	basically, the idea is that if a company has more money, it will hire more people, which reduces unemployment and boosts the economy.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	it can play on your sense of doubt increasing the feeling of risk and uncertainty without a corresponding rational basis.
Prescription Refill Reminder	what if you did not realize you were out of refills ?	you are the only one taking it so you are going to see yourself getting low, you are going to know exactly how many more days you have left, i ca not imagine it being a surprise.
The importance of narratives in games.	narratives are incredibly important to good games.	game play is not everything.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	and i do not think any kind of precedent was set then and i doubt it will be set now.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	that is what most atheists do.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	it was not until companies like aol started to see a profit that any private investment and control happened to the industry.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	want a thin, slightly crispy pancake ? easy.
Introverts' discomfort with extroverts' questioning.	i have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being  forced to talk  by being asked questions.	with regards to the introvert extrovert continuum: this not only exists but the associated behaviors will manifest situationally in everyone.
Difficulty with chemistry conversion problems.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	i did not understand a thing and, no matter how many times it was explained to me, i was still clueless.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	this will probably increase the likelihood of diseases where your immune system attacks healthy parts of your body.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	i see patterns throughout world religions, rooted in natural law, and tend to agree with adi shankara and his concept of brahman.
Negative effects of technological conveniences.	the darker side is that technological conveniences are often less necessary.	if it is honestly just the inconvenience that you enjoy then it sounds like you are suffering from a version of masochism.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	brazil croatia could end their game today at  , for example.
Debate on punishment for criminals.	i hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.	this group has the reverse bias those with lighter sentences, who served their time early, and stayed out of prison, are more heavily represented in the population of felons who are living in society.
Debate over the moral high ground of the South in the Civil War.	i also believe the south had the moral high ground in the war.	i disagree.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	and  of them has to spend time doing something that benefits nobody, as a result of something the ruler dictates.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	this is why it is the default position.
Controversy over offensive sports team names.	while i understand why a team name like  redskins  is a bigoted name, i do not understand why people get offended over something so inconsequential.	keep in mind here, believing that other people  ought not to be offended  by the name is also not the same as  not understanding why they feel that way.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	let is assume hitler did not want war with the west.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	this means they ca not give amazon prime priority over netflix because amazon paid and netflix did not.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	jews believe in a single god while christians believe in a triune god; these cannot be the same god.
The ethics of giving to the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	the assumption that selfishness is the optimal strategy is a testable assertion.
The cost of being a superpower.	if we were no longer a superpower, we would not have to spend billions of dollars being be the policeman for other countries and trying and often failing to spread democracy elsewhere.	this is not altruism, it is  for our own interests.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	in fact homosexuality mirrors heterosexuality.
Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	he could not get support for stannis, renly or balon.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	if you cannot grok that, myself or others can go further into detail.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	if, what you do not like, is this that this group is able to make decisions you do not agree with then you have a problem with democracy.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	around the world.
Nudity in Men's Locker Rooms.	which i believe directly leads to people not feeling comfortable in their own naked bodies.	so porn makes people not like the way they look ? i hear girls complaining about their hair more than anything else.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	that would cause great tensions and possibly wars.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	no, do you believe in zeus ? because acknowledging a similarity is not the same as belief in the thing.
Criteria for Involuntary Admission Scheduling.	note that criteria for involuntary admission scheduling varies between states and countries but generally includes risk of harm to self, or to others.	because their anti vaccination stance presents a risk to themselves via contracting disease or others either via spreading disease, or preventing their children from being vaccinated , then this is grounds for involuntary admission and treatment in a psychiatric facility.
Eliminating the use of the word "potential" in reference to humans.	as a last point, what else, if not a human ?	there is evidence that lasting memories and identity do not start for form until  and a half years.
Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	like what ? the people would never accept him, not only because of his horrible personality, the people accepted joffrey, and he would have remained king if not for a massive conspiracy against him.
Negative effects of corporal punishment.	spanking has also been linked to drug abuse, criminal behavior, and mental/emotional issues.	there are variety of things that correlate with negative outcomes that we do not outlaw.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	it can play on your sense of doubt increasing the feeling of risk and uncertainty without a corresponding rational basis.
Individuality and Equal Opportunity in Society	i do not want the same as others, i want a chance to fulfill my own dreams and objectives.	where the problem arises is when the powerful subjugate the weak and the temptation to do so is clearly part of human nature, given how universal the behaviour seems to be.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	their dreams are what they want from life, whether their goals be personal, financial, etc.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	so the test for whether or not to hire another person is whether a new hire will generate more profit.
Criminal disenfranchisement and empathy-based morality in voting rights.	if we can agree that laws are based on commonly accepted standards of morality and that morality is based on empathy, then people who have proven their lack of empathy through their own criminality should  almost by definition  not be given the right to vote.	it is not making society any better to keep these people from voting.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	many people addicted to smoking are older and have families; would a mother really begin associating with criminals just to continue something she knows is a destructive habit she is been meaning to quit anyway.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	and now the homework questions.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	supernatural things do not exist, and the word describes something that violates our understanding of nature.
Frustration with the American welfare system and desire to play games.	why ca not i just fuck the world and ask for the social welfare payment and play every days some good mmorpg games huh ?	you are under the impression that the government just hands out money to lazy people, and that is not at all the case.
Proof of God's existence through logic.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	again, only evidence about the brain.
The nature of evidence and how it relates to God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	it seems that it is often assumed that only scientific evidence will do and to be fair it would be the best kind to show that something existed.
Russian aggression towards Ukraine.	the government of the united states and ukraine have both denounced russia is actions as against  international law .	think of it as a mexican standoff.
The difficulty of winning the war against terrorism.	we could literally blow up every remaining terrorist, and we still would have lost the war.	imagine all, or even  being  home  because they never enlisted.
Tattoos and their significance.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	i think that this person wants the world to know that they a have a daughter and b must be a great person because they successfully reproduced and care about said offspring.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	i kind of agree with you, in that i do not see any problem with any individual game being very very male heavy.
Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	also heres a list of great things to come out of world war : penicillin, has probably saved more lives than people killed in the war.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	income disparity is growing, the country still imports many things, and detroit is failing.
Purpose of affirmative action in college admissions.	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	you have not highlighted any actual harm, can you specify exactly who is harmed and how ?.
Discussion about a losing war and betrayal of a leader.	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	for dozens if not hundreds of families, it was no longer a matter of duty to a distant liege lord in winterfell.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	this will probably increase the likelihood of diseases where your immune system attacks healthy parts of your body.
Identifying personal strengths.	my strengths lie in literature and english.	you likely have not been exposed enough, or pushed hard enough, few people are.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	want a big thick, sexy god of a pancake ? easy.
Parental Influence and Gender Roles.	similarly, two fathers ca not breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods.	so what singles this out ?.
Criticism of modern art and its value.	nothing of cultural or practical value is produced.	are completely ideological.
The importance of narratives in games.	narratives are incredibly important to good games.	imagine if monopoly had labels like  blue square   instead of  boardwalk.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	with a few exceptions, suicidal ideation is abnormal.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	even shining metropolis has its share of such.
Criticism of a writer's skills and downvotes.	and for having a lot of discussion, what is up with the pile of downvotes ?	i guess that people downvote you because of the bad analogy.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	i do not think it is cowardly but i do believe it can be selfish.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	smoking, on the other hand, is more of a nervous habit.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	it is their right to prohibit firearms in their stores, but we do not have to like it and we do not have to continue to shop there, as daily gun carriers.
Success and Personal Capability	i am defining better here as how well equipped i am to be successful in achieving my goals in life.	but that is a bad definition.
Restaurant tipping policy.	i think the main issue i have is that servers pool their tips usually, so a bad server will still get an equal cut of the money compared to the best server there.	it is also disliked for exactly the reason you state bad servers benefit and good servers lose out.
Immigration and US Economy	why ca not we shuffle around illegal immigrants into other developed countries in order to lessen the strain on the us economy ?	they do not have the same needs or expenses, so it is really not fair to draw from one to anotehr.
The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	the best argument ? every major religion discourages an emphasis on the physical, because such an emphasis distracts from an emphasis on the spiritual.
Chopsticks and their practicality.	but for practically everything else, there is just no god damn reason to use chopsticks when western utensils are more practical, and better for the environment.	chinese people, under the cultivation of confucianism, consider the knife and fork bearing sort of violence, like cold weapons.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	over thinking can definitely be a problem.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	whether from god, or from nature, a challenge has appeared.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	i am not going to be a novelist, journalist, or anything of the sort.
Criticism of the free market and Luxottica's business practices.	that is not how the free market should work.	if luxottica is not using force or coercion i.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	or that managing emotional situations and relationships is most important.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	i believe they can only account for me the way an actuary can attempt to render the status of something mathematically with an eye for values and eventually profit.
Chopstick etiquette and usage.	i do realize that chopsticks are more appropriate for a few select foods.	chopsticks were strongly advocated by the great chinese philosopher confucius  bc.
Discipline of children and spanking as a form of punishment.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	but what about spanking at a later age ?  ?  ?  ? would you be ok with that ? sure, spanking by itself does not encourage critical thinking.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	for most people that means they do not leave their local area because it is easier to interview for a job when you can easily get to the interview spot.
Proof of God's existence through logic.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	criticism carries a burden of proof.
Concealed Handguns and their Necessity.	even if you have a concealed handgun, there still really is not a reason for it.	very well.
Taxation and Wealth Redistribution for Large Corporations.	firstly, higher tax rates for large corporations would redistribute wealth in society, without greatly affecting the rich individuals in question.	how would you prevent the corporations from simply moving their operations over seas ? i am all in favor of getting people out of abject poverty.
Views on Hierarchy and Equality in Society	i like hierarchy, and find leadership and social status motivating.	i concur with this ideal.
Israeli aggression towards neighboring countries.	israel has been continually attacking their neighbours for more land or cause a weakening mayhem upon them; lebanon, syria, iraq soon iran.	despite this, people in us think / was totally unfounded terrorist attack without any provocation by israeli led us.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	you will be constantly feeling terrible and stressed as soon as you have not had your cigarette on time.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	this is why it is the default position.
Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	it sounds like you are doing something similar but taking it out on others.
Job dissatisfaction and management issues.	my managers overlook how much i help the company and how loyal i am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, i  talk back  too much.	instead of blaming others, you ought to look inwardly and take the advice of your manager.
Criticism of Libertarianism and Government Monopolies.	i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.	show me any facts on this.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	its not enough just to have the archive, we need to tell the story.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	other countries lost their colonies as well, but the british empire was the largest and the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.
Human adaptability and survival.	humans will simply adapt and move on, we are an incredibly resourceful species and have collectively survived or overcome every single challenge posed to us.	there is a lot of science to back this up.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	but what is wrong with pursuing a career that you actually enjoy ? why ca not a job be both.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	no rich person is going to decide to be poor because taxes are discouraging him.
Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	its not like the people who originally inhabited these parts of the world were affected well by colonialism.
Collective action and political influence for social change.	the people can collectively rise up and overthrow those with unjust power.	what should be done, then ? of course, we can do the same in a monarchy; it is called revolution.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	so, any given establishment would have to not only teach their staff these drinks, but also reteach them constantly as they are inevitably forgotten through disuse.
Chopstick etiquette and soup slurping.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	they are not impractical if you cut the meal before serving it.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	my argument for religion is that good qualities can be found within it arguably, that is its saving grace.
Religion and Evil People.	evil, twisted people, but still just mortal people.	without religion, evil people would not stop being evil.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	°c, which is the best estimate for no serious efforts taken to stop the warming would be a dystopian world.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	sorry pal, but that is the whole world for the entirety of human history.
Economic modeling and impact of a policy.	as such i feel all debate around the topic right now is pretty meaningless.	i think that hopefully i am wrong, and that someone can show me a way economists could model for the introduction of such a policy and at least have a rough idea of it is impact.
The impact of animals on human survival.	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	there is no reason to panic over animal extinctions, there is no tangible benefit to preserving animal species.
Effectiveness of Advertising.	i have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.	quick, what do you order ? well, you can list bud, coors and miller right off the top of your head.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	it is very much as important or more important to everyone is lives as telephone service, so why do we not regulate it as we do telephones ?.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	you may find more people who are more socially reserved online, but that totally works for a lot of people who  want  less social aspects to their life.
Teaching children about lies and authority figures.	l kids, or that spiderman exists, or that daniel radcliff really is a wizard.	however, lying about santa in no way teaches critical thinking, when you live with this lie for several years.
Foreign aid and small business support in Africa.	i also feel more money should be spent on foreign aid, especially in the form of small business support in africa, for example.	what about the small groups of rebels who wage guerilla war on a region ? there is no point is trying to seed small business when there is so much instability.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	too much doubt is folly.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	before giving my reasons, i would like to counter a couple of your points:   and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.
Reducing genetic diversity.	i do not consider reduction of genetic diversity a real problem.	why would you not give your child the best of all possible lives ? i would not want that for me or my kids.
Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	so when you say  iset back  most of the third world, i think thats a great thing.
Paid paternity leave and funding for early childhood development.	rather than have the market have to take the cost of new fathers, we should have a transfer of funds to early childhood development and new parenting aid.	i think that men should be viewed as parents, equal in ability to women excepting a few biological things that are really only factors for as long as the woman is breast feeding.
Difficulty with chemistry conversion problems.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	what if your teacher was teaching you things not to mix ? what if your teacher was getting you to understand how some things could be dangerous when combined ?.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	he tries to be objectively just, and is stubborn in the pursuit of it.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	again, this involves a non standard redefinition of a word.
Morality and cheating.	i am arguing that there is no pragmatic reason why you should not cheat.	i do not know if we inhabit such a universe.
Raising the driving age and preventing texting while driving.	i think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	if you are going to prevent people who have jobs  is also the age for that , from diving to their job, then you should also be calling to raise the minimum working age to .
Introverts' discomfort with extroverts' questioning.	i have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being  forced to talk  by being asked questions.	there is a difference between being asked questions and being continuously asked questions after giving responses that clearly signal a desire to not participate in the current discussion.
Chopsticks and their practicality.	but for practically everything else, there is just no god damn reason to use chopsticks when western utensils are more practical, and better for the environment.	they are not actually cutting down trees, but cutting bamboo which grows back really fast.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	my grandfather smoked for  years and then quit.
Atheism as a belief or doctrine.	c the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	and is not that the sine qua non of rationality ? that a is a and is not  a and not a  ? are you in essence arguing that being in a state of uncertainty is rational ? just for the god issue ? i presume you would grant the mathematician the right to be certain about his triangles.
The effectiveness of vaccinations.	the evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.	in fact, rationality involves each person making their own choices on risks and benefits.
Existence of phenomena and the role of an all-powerful God.	the existence of these phenomena would require an all powerful god to permit them.	disclaimer: i am agnostic, i am kind of playing devils advocate here.
Discipline and Spanking in Children's Behavior.	kids these days are unruly and need to be taught discipline !	you could replace  spanking  with any form of discipline here and make the exact same statement you are making.
***Topic: The irrationality of atheism.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	very well.
Smoking and its justifications.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	you are taking a huge risk, and in that sense you are doing something  wrong  because you may end up jeopardizing your future.
The nature of evidence and how it relates to God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	let me start by saying, that evidence need not be scientific.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	this is also not necessarily true.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	bitters are an essential ingredient.
Software failures in vehicles.	why the point as software failures, malfunctions or whatever would mean you ca not go anywhere.	just like a normal car can malfunction.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	this is a common problem in high school.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	this is due to a runaway greenhouse effect, which if throughout the course of our time on this planet we completely ignore, will very likely occur in the future due to various feedback mechanisms with respect to climate.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	beef jerky, barbeque, gumbo, tamales, stuffed peppers, bean soups, and a great many squash preparations were all directly developed from native american cooking.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	some people take the attitude that,  well, if people really need help, then the government will help them !.
Causes of WWII and Lebensraum concept.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	hitler had been gobbling up neighboring countries even after saying that he would not do so.
Men's primary concern: Romantic Love.	men, however  do  have romantic love as their primary concern.	what makes you think this ? do women  say  this ? if not, what makes you think that they do not live up to their portrayal in the media ? do you think it would be evidence  for  romantic love if women were  less  picky ? or at least, they fall in love quicker and more deeply than women.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	a you do not know that, b this sets precedent for the opposition as well.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	people hate seeing others succeed, and will try to bring you down for wanting to live an awesome life, so they can justify there own situation.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	why should there be an arbitrary line when it comes to certain types of recreational drug use ? you yourself consume caffeine for purely recreational purposes, despite that not being your primary objective, but you have not made any attempt to justify why caffeine is alright, but other drugs are not.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	you will be able to sort through more people more quickly online.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	school is also not there to teach you things you already understand or could easily understand, it is to push the limits of your mind.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	basically, the idea is that if a company has more money, it will hire more people, which reduces unemployment and boosts the economy.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	however religion is often the reason given as to why it should be done.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	you go onto to cite truzzi, and there are some interesting points he has made.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	that is why i get annoyed when people defend the classical definition of god.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	many people would be just to find something they enjoy and to be able to make enough money from it to live comfortably.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	why in the world would you treat those to groups the same.
Doubting the practicality of learning moles to grams conversion.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	the same can be said of most subjects but these subjects are made mandatory in order to give students a wide range of areas where they can gain a basic understanding of a topic and find out whether it is something that interests them enough that they might like to continue their education in that subject and maybe even pursue a career in that field or that it does not interest them, like chemistry in your case.
Fantasy character interactions and offspring.	if two of the characters get married, i want to see the ridiculous offspring of my roommate and jennifer lawrence for example.	this element would be lost with the addition of same sex marriages small factor, but still.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	kinda hard to challenge research you have not presented, and it is very unscientific on your part.
Training dogs for different purposes.	dogs can be trained to smell cancer, sense danger, lead the blind or disabled, or simply do a number of amusing tricks.	i think it depends on what your needs and objectives are.
Difficulty of Combos and Lack of Advanced Techniques in a Game.	combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there is no l cancelling, wavedashing or other related high level techniques that can be used.	having more random feature less arenas, for example, is good for anyone who likes fairness, whether they are tournament players or casual ones.
Animal exploitation and consent argument.	the only way the consent argument can be strong is if you are arguing from the standpoint we should not exploit animals period.	for example if we are talking about using a mouse for cancer research then there are a lot of people that benefit from that, and many animals could potentially benefit from it too people would love to be able to cure cancer in their pets for example.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	the metabolism of c plants becomes much less efficient with higher temperatures, which would mean much lower yields of less nutritious food.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	atheism is not inherently rational or irrational, as the reasons for atheism are varied.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	it is likely that we would become so advanced with our genetic manipulation, that you simply purchase pre manufactured genetic material.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	furthermore, native american settlements are popular tourist attractions in several states, especially around areas where the pueblo and related peoples settled.
The ethics of giving to the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	do you really think there is nothing to be gained outside your own family and people you already know ? neither act is compulsory.
Gender Quality in Two Nations.	let is say nation a has men who have more superior qualities mentioned above than nation b, but fewer women of high quality.	however, nation b, has many women of superior quality, and fewer men of low high quality.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	to me the fact that you have likely benefited from tax dollars in each of the life experiences you have described, is an indication that lawful taxation is a good thing.
Overpaid athletes in professional sports.	for instance, nba players make tens of millions of dollars a year for what ?	they make tens of millions of dollars because they are part of an organization which produces an incredible amount of money.
Challenges of using chopsticks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	you can cut or at least split food with chopsticks about as effectively as you could with, say, the edge of a fork.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	also, no one complied with the tax code.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	again i am not sure why you are asserting this, i have no idea if this is true or not.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	once one state makes such a change, it can make it easier for other states to gain support for such changes if it works well.
Preference between cats and dogs as pets.	cats, even when used to human contact, will frequently attack a human without reason as  play .	rats can be trained to detect tb and landmines.
The nature of evidence and how it relates to God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	you cannot do this with any god.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	we care about ourselves, our families, our  tribe , but the bigger and more faceless the group becomes the more we find it difficult to care.
The impact of animals on human survival.	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	nature has killed far more animals than we ever will, and yet the earth has survived.
Misconceptions about the size of the USA and Europe.	i feel like many europeans really do not understand how large the usa is.	here is a comparison of the two of them, at scale and with the right projection URL you can see that the distance between portugal and the baltics is comparable to the distance between california and the great lakes.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	the sole purpose is to kill or seriously injure an animal or worse, a person.
The Thomistic Perspective on Homosexuality and Natural Law.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it is a huge appeal to nature/naturalistic fallacy to claim that something is good because it is in line with an alleged  natural purpose , or  as nature intended.
Argument for legalizing all crimes to save money.	why not make all crimes legal, then the police do not need to exist and we save all the money !	the law should handle destruction and victimization, not personal recreation.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	someone correct me if i am wrong on this, but the electoral system pretty much  is  proportional for anything below presidential elections.
Opinions on Wealth Distribution	do you think that no one deserves to experience superwealth ?	many social services are funded primarily by charity.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	also, a shootout does provide a  definitive conclusion , just not in the manner that you would like.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	for example that the word  billion years old, which specifically contradicts what the bible says , years old.
Subjectivity of Monetary Value and Understanding Price Determination Systems.	that is, i think that monetary value is inherently subjective and that we do not usefully understand the systems that determine the price of a good, or an appropriate salary for work performed.	you would have us all do different work, but receive the same pay.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	i would like to hear arguments for the effectiveness of education in creating people that will produce profit for the community in which pays for their education through their tax dollars.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	the problem with different treatment is there is no way to know if it is warranted just by gender.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	good people should not be forgotten, they should be celebrated.
Reducing genetic diversity.	i do not consider reduction of genetic diversity a real problem.	you know those parents who always wanted to be a great musician or a great athelete, so they pressure their kid to spend hours in practice ? and even if the kid turns out successful as a programmer or something, the parent is still disappointed that they did not get the star qb son they wanted ? now imagine that the parent paid a large sum of money to genetically engineer the kid to be a perfect doctor or football player or whatever.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	just because something to an extreme is bad does not mean it is bad in it is entirety.
Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	being good at chess just means you are good at chess.
Extreme views in atheism and religion.	i feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect.	it harbours hatred towards a particular group of people; people who hold a different life view than their own.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	technically yes.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	for example, instead of having the government allocate as much money for food stamps, they would rather run additional private food banks and help out personally those they know who need help.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	sure, people are allowed to make poor decisions with their health.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	the only good thing about breaking bad was the acting.
Criticism of libertarianism's impact on poverty and prejudice.	libertarianism leads to more poverty, blocks the prevention of racism and other prejudice, and ensures that poor people have little hope of escaping their plight.	you have provided no evidence for this assertion.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	before you counter that ignorance is bliss, and happiness is happiness, consider the difference between the happiness of, say, a jolly farmer who works and plays hard versus the happiness of the heroin junkie squatting on a warehouse mattress oblivious to the world but on a high.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	big difference, thin line.
Gender Equality and Chivalry	i do not think you can have gender equality and chivalry coexist.	how so ? i am expecting a kiss or some physical contact from a female, is that sexist ? i do not see why it can only be one of those.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	and the more pessimistic estimates like  °c would probably mean the end of humanity.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	morality has an explanation.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	now you can deliver more newspapers in the same time, thus increasing your capabilities or, however, you could also choose to keep delivering  newspapers, albeit at a faster time.
Purpose of affirmative action in college admissions.	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	why do you think this is the purpose of affirmative action ? its purpose is to give historically disadvantaged kids a better shot at getting in.
Disadvantages of smoking and the issue of respect.	i ca not see any reason for a rational person to smoke.	if i blow a whole pack of smoke in your face, you are in the clear.
Atheism and the Afterlife	i believe there is no god, no heaven and no hell.	in the grand scheme of things, we are less than a drop in the ocean, our time is insignificant.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	blaming them on gotham is just a cop out.
Fear of death and afterlife beliefs.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	it is like being afraid of the dark because you are scared there is monsters.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	no, if you have cocktails on the menu, you should know how to make the cocktails that are on the menu.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	is it a problem that a given video game has only male characters ? not necessarily; there were no front line female soldiers on d day.
The nature of evidence and how it relates to God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	the question you posed by  atheist persondude  does not specify that.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	at this point, as long as you are not stupid as fuck or do retarded shit which is partly based on how obedient you are , you are already good to go.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	but the truth is that most humans are unable to separate their minds from their bodies.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	and the integrity of one is self is the very thing  from which the capacity for happiness  arises and is a property of.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	i am going to focus on a specific bit.
The Definition of Atheism and Belief in Mythological Gods	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	all things that can also happen in atheism.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	some of these criticisms may be claims themselves, saying there exists a critical error in thinking makes it necessary to present the error else the lack of evidence will lead it to be rejected.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	there are provable gods out there, but none have been proven.
Atheism and the Path to Finding God	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	scientific or historical evidence supporting the existence of god would probably change the minds of most atheist on earth.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	some of the profiles.
Debate on punishment for criminals.	i hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.	often, it means a serious crime generally.
Fantasy character interactions and offspring.	if two of the characters get married, i want to see the ridiculous offspring of my roommate and jennifer lawrence for example.	you can make your friends/celebrities/fictional characters, and watch them interact with one another.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	no, if you have cocktails on the menu, you should know how to make the cocktails that are on the menu.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	my guess is that no, you do not believe in zeus, thor, odin, ba al, mithra, gaia, nut, arceus, unicron, r hllor, the crimson king, melkor, sheogorath, grenth, farore, shinnok, khorne, frith, jehovah , or asd f the god i just invented, etc.
Atheism and the Afterlife	i believe there is no god, no heaven and no hell.	when we witness an individual living a life full of suffering, we believe that absent any intervention suffering will comprise the totality of their experience and time on earth as a human being.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	people gain pleasure from meaningless sex.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	what they could further contribute to your life is probably over.
The rationality of believing in God.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	it has to be provable to us and we are at this particular moment alive.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	let is say you beat me until i do not cry anymore; do you really think i have stopped feeling pain ? or is it more likely that i am just not showing it to avoid your beatings ? men who cry easily and are too connected to their emotions ca not survive in the world.
Immorality of not paying taxes.	and if you do not participate fully, you are an immoral person ?	i do not believe that necessarily makes a person themselves immoral, though.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	i have nothing against other drugs, but i personally have not had enough interest to try them.
Misconceptions about the size of the USA and Europe.	i feel like many europeans really do not understand how large the usa is.	and if we go all the way to western russia which  is  part of europe , the distance is almost comparable to the west coast east coast distance in the us.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	which is it that is inhibiting your learning ? confidence is trusting yourself to be able to learn.
The problem of evil in philosophy.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	the classic restatement is that god cannot be omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient because a god having all three of these qualities would not allow so much evil to exist in the world.
Baker refusing to make cake for polygamous marriage.	what if a baker refused to make a cake for a polygamous marriage ?	we do not live in this sort of society.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	the thing is, people do not want congress to have term limits.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	depending on how far you move, there is a cost associated with moving your things.
Origins and significance of "Deutschlandlied"	deutschlandlied is a song of unity, peace, and brotherhood from the very first stanza.	so, that line, and by extension, the entire stanza, is actually a point of shame for germans, for right wingers, because  greater germany  lost territory, and for left wingers, because of nazis.
Negotiating fair payment for services/goods.	the service/goods someone is providing exceeds the value of x dollars the buyer is offering.	you pay them based on the supply and demand of capable workers.
Comparing effects of cannabis and alcohol use.	cannabis also mellows you out, makes you more relaxed and heightens the imagination and improves creativity.	you have a really bias view almost as bad as the bias that anti weed programs have.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	their policy makes their patrons less safe, not more so.
Future MMORPG games and their immersive experience.	most of mmorpg games thats coming in future will be much better then what i have played before.	if you are satisfied with games today, that is great you can probably be almost as satisfied when you are older.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	why would you not want to devote this time to something that you enjoy, or why would not we encourage our children to do just that ? some people would be just fine with the first option you mentioned.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	there is not a center of consciousness; consciousness is the continuous activity of the brain.
Comparison of chopsticks and forks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	again, as has already been discussed, chopstick users do not forgo the use of spoons.
Controversy over offensive sports team names.	while i understand why a team name like  redskins  is a bigoted name, i do not understand why people get offended over something so inconsequential.	it is possible to understand why someone else feels a certain way without also feeling that way yourself.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	a system that oppresses minorities as a matter of rote, and where police are often on a power trip  even when a good majority of the populace is armed ; guns really do not cause crime.
Affirmative action and merit-based scholarships.	i believe that all scholarships should be merit based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill  race quotas  to  diversify the campus  in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.	if you are used to see people with certain traits in power and those traits prove to be irrelevant, you wo not expect those traits to be a problem.
The dangers of smoking and developing addiction.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	you will develop a habit like this, that habit can turn to addiction.
Misconceptions about men's rights and pick-up artist communities.	i am completely comfortable lumping all these groups men is rights, pick up artistry, the red pill, puahate together.	URL men is rights has nothing whatsoever to do with dominating women into sexual submission.
Fear of death and afterlife beliefs.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	it is not  the most likely explanation  we simply do not know.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	having a crisis of faith is not uncommon nor is it unmanageable.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	imagine what it would be like to live somewhere where there is no society forcing you to pay taxes, sounds great not to be able to pay taxes but then again without society you likely wo not have anything to pay taxes on.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	if a lot of people starts choosing the polyamory life style, it is only a matter of time before it becomes usual.
The importance of science in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.

Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	emotions like fear come and go throughout your life.
The purpose of education.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	in life you will be required to convert units, i do not think examples are needed.
Forced abortions and a woman's right to choose.	those who get pregnant without the three years minimum income would be subject to forced abortions.	if the government is able to control who has children, would they also be allowed to force some people to have children who would not normally ? can they limit the number of children ? would allowing this open up the possibility for the government to mandate abortion or reproduction based on other factors besides income, such as criminal history or genetic factors ?.
Negative effects of technological conveniences.	the darker side is that technological conveniences are often less necessary.	technology has far from diminished your health, if anything it has vastly improved it.
Comparison of Japan's acknowledgement of genocide and Germany's acknowledgement of the Holocaust.	and the japanese wo not even acknoledge the genocide in the same way germany does with the holocaust, that is just rubbing salt in the wound.	it is been like that for  years.
The effects of restricted nudity and internet pornography.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	the problem is that porn is typically the first and only area where young adults see nude bodies which further sexualizes and makes nudity  wrong.
Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	under your argument that the federal government should only be concerned about human rights would mean that these issues should only be taken care of by the federal government and the states should take care of things like infrastructure, schools, hospitals, and things like that.
Debate over the moral high ground of the South in the Civil War.	i also believe the south had the moral high ground in the war.	could you go into this in more detail please ? after all, the south did attack the united states federal government to begin the war.
Philosophical Writing	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	this is akin to saying  i do not see the big deal about painting.
Obesity and Bad Decision Making.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	your reptile brain interprets  hunger  as  holy shit i am starving find some food.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	it can play on your sense of doubt increasing the feeling of risk and uncertainty without a corresponding rational basis.
The role of religion in preventing evil and war.	there would still be wars, there would still be people who rose to positions of power for their own benefit.	generally, when people say  religion is bad , they mean dogmatic beliefs are bad.
Human adaptability and survival.	humans will simply adapt and move on, we are an incredibly resourceful species and have collectively survived or overcome every single challenge posed to us.	nature has killed far more animals than we ever will, and yet the earth has survived.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	a doctor earns their title, a duke does not.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	also, trying to spread anything on them is a giant fucking pain in the ass.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	however, i think that a large collection of these points, averaged over the entire data set, does.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	a job is just that, a job.
Pizza sizes and confusion.	my point is that when places like dominos and pizza hut sell you s, m, l pies, you have no way to know what you are getting.	what would be so hard about that ? the reason for not having this information in the actual advertisement is you do not need to present the watcher with more information than they can digest in a short  or  second ad.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	it seems that you more or less want it justified.
Opinions on Wealth Distribution	do you think that no one deserves to experience superwealth ?	first, i do not think that most people think rich people need to donate  all  or even a majority of their wealth to charities.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	this is the rub: if they decided to do this, two problems would arise: one, me and people like me would confront their force with force.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	actually, if the situation is open and every person involved in the relationship is aware and ok with the terms, i think that is accepted by most people anyway.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	the burden of proof is on those which make the claim, if you claim the existence or correlation of something, then the burden falls unto you to provide evidence of it.
Trading with countries with poor human rights records.	why would one trade with a country that has poor human rights records ?	education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages.
Smoking and its justifications.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	alright, so back to the question.
Proper use of chopsticks for eating delicate food.	you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	using a fork/pronged grilling fork is a guaranteed way to ruin a perfectly good stake, or chicken by puncturing it.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	tl;dr:  the wire is the great american novel, and each episode is a chapter.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	i do not mean that as an insult or anything, but it really sounds like you are having trouble empathizing with others.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	government regulations are written by large corporate interests who collude with officials in government.
Cohl's peace after killing Childress and his role in religion.	however, after cohl and hart kill childress cohl seems truly at peace, even though he has not gotten the full truth or come anywhere near getting justice for the victims.	i think the reason they left the hospital as they did was proof they will continue the hunt.
Misconceptions about Science and Evolution.	humanity is understanding of science, particularly of biology and physics, are hopelessly incorrect on almost every level.	do you dispute their work ?.
Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	do you know how much it costs to move to a new state ? different places have different property values, so depending on where you live, you might not make enough money selling your current house to buy a new one wherever you want to live.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	but we also need to listen to reason and take care of ourselves and each other.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	the sole purpose is to kill or seriously injure an animal or worse, a person.
Origins and significance of "Deutschlandlied"	deutschlandlied is a song of unity, peace, and brotherhood from the very first stanza.	it is important to understand its origins: it was written in , some thirty years prior to the unification of the german empire under prussian auspices, and nearly a hundred before the nazis came to power.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	and do not try to say that people think eating mcdonalds everyday is healthy.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	so is dany, who kills potential political allies a shortsighted, passionate mistake.

Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	you go to work/school/college and everyone calls you by a female name, again, you feel like this is not right, but who are you to argue, they are clearly addressing a woman.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	i personally think religion is a poor choice, and that it can lead to harm, but i disagree with you on the reasons why for the most part.

Gender identity and transition options.	i feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the  i feel like i should have been male/female  argument.	i am going to assume you are male, forgive me if i am wrong.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	unions  exist  because manufacture became more efficient.
Opinions on tattoos as a superficial trend.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	what makes a person  interesting  anyway ? is a tattoo commemorating a person is mother less interesting than a tattoo commemorating a person is experience ? i think that this person wants the world to know that they a have a daughter and b must be a great person because they successfully reproduced and care about said offspring.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	now consider a rock band in our society.
Disadvantages of gas-powered vehicles.	crappy gas powered cars and trucks until the dinosaur juice runs out and/or the earth just flat out explodes, whichever comes first.	i also think that people forget that just because the car is electric does not mean it is really more environmentally friendly.

Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	the first error is using metrics of superiority that are arbitrary.

Gender equality in front line warfighting jobs.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	maybe woman are not as effective as men as front line warfighters should not this be done on an individual level ? similar to how men are not  automatically  qualified and admitted into these kinds of jobs just for being men, so should women not be automatically barred for being women.
Government's role in contract enforcement.	so why would the government want to ease your financial life when you fall deeply in love with someone else ?	the real question would be, why is religion trying to get control of marriage ?.

Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	even if this was true, the way to solve it would not be dictating how many partners one person gets to have.

The ending of a novel.	in the end he learns to love big brother and is finally happy, his last moment is one of complete bliss.	i think what you are missing here is the level of violation that has occurred.
The role of religion in preventing evil and war.	there would still be wars, there would still be people who rose to positions of power for their own benefit.	there would still be wars, there would still but you need religion, or something like religion, namely dogma, to make a good person do bad things.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	the old religious maxime:  for what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul ?   is true for every human.
The Definition of Atheism and Belief in Mythological Gods	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	an atheist might reject the presented evidence, because citing  wouldeath  and  wouldrugs  are really not very compelling or make sense to be honest.
Offensive policies and societal reactions to offense.	i understand finding racial profiling or stop and frisk offensive, policies that actually impact your life that are sanctioned by the state.	you like strawberry ice cream, and hate chocolate ? whatever.
Causes of WWII and Lebensraum concept.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	he did not stop at austria, he did not stop at czechoslovakia, and it was pretty clear that he would not stop at danzig.
Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	i am going to assume you are male, forgive me if i am wrong.
Economic modeling and impact of a policy.	as such i feel all debate around the topic right now is pretty meaningless.	because, this is the weakness in your plan.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	now imagine them asking you why they should have done it.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	if you train your dog to attack strangers,  enjoy the lawsuit  and watching your dog get put down.
Disagreeing with Webster's Dictionary and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.	disagreeing with webster is dictionary and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.	so i will add them as replies here, segregating them into each point.
Subjectivity of opinions on musicians and people.	there are loads of better musicians and many more interesting people.	no, they did not.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	what you should change about your view is that dogs are objectively better pets.
Opinions on Wealth Distribution	do you think that no one deserves to experience superwealth ?	most people are pretty happy with the way bill gates and warren buffet handle their money even though they are among the richest people in the world, so i do not think the issue is the existence of super rich people.
Baker refusing to make cake for polygamous marriage.	what if a baker refused to make a cake for a polygamous marriage ?	there is no such thing as a  gay wedding cake.
Gender equality in front line warfighting jobs.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	you can set objective criteria that need to be met by all applicants.
Equality and Individuality	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	it is unfair to disqualify someone from something simply because of their gender or race, or sexual orientation, etc.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	is this not enough of a profit to justify an educations system ? and even if we forget about that, we still need a system to evaluate students, so the rest of society can differentiate the capable from the not so capable.
Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	of course eddard, being dead, was not able to communicate this.
Risks and Rewards of Teenage Sex.	however, i feel like the risks of sex as a teenager far outweigh the rewards.	you will avoid more unwanted pregnancy and stds by teaching kids how to avoid them rather than just telling them to have sex which the majority of teenagers will pay no attention to.
Motivation for Suicide	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	this seems to me to be a confirmation that you believe there is no way to commit suicide that is not  amisguided.
Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	suggests the latter, and it really just sounds like you are projecting concerns about yourself onto others.
Debate on the effectiveness of killing to solve problems.	when we can just rid the world of these things by killing them.	trying to help people is a joke ? your opinion appears disingenuous.
Criticism of Libertarianism and Government Monopolies.	i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.	many libertarians believe in social liberalism, including equal rights for all sexual orientations, genders, and races.
Complexity of Evolution vs Creationism.	complex topics like evolution and celestial mechanics would require thousands of years of discovery to even begin to comprehend.	do you dispute their work ?.
Paid paternity leave and funding for early childhood development.	rather than have the market have to take the cost of new fathers, we should have a transfer of funds to early childhood development and new parenting aid.	the problem ultimately that i come to is it in no way takes into account whether this is morally a good thing or not.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	jews believe in a single god while christians believe in a triune god; these cannot be the same god.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	he then suffered an unfortunate and improbable defeat, but he rallied plenty of people regardless.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	the arising of consciousness is one of the larger scientific mysteries at the moment, but it could possibly be that given a powerful enough computer, and the appropriate code, it could attain consciousness.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	divided into groups, the first was taken to the edge of the pit and shot, the others being forced to watch.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	determinism/fatalism/predeterminism has thus historically been the bastion of those who rationalize away personal ownership for past actions or inactions, or future ones whether it is by a  if god wills it , or  inshallah , or  genes/atoms/hormones/parents/environment made me do it !.
Gender identity and expression.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	they are just born that way.
Beauty pageants and child safety.	from what i have seen, beauty pageants take on a  cutesy  vibe, not a sexual one.	do i think a lot of pageant moms are essentially child abusers who sexualize their children to relive days when they were still young and pretty ? yes.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	the  thrill  of unknown partners can easily manifest itself in other vices.
Controversy over young girls wearing suggestive clothing.	worst is their parent has no issues with it.	the  y/o with a  limited  capacity for understanding this subject ? is the  parent  of the child creating an environment to allow their child to be sexualized ? or perhaps,  maybe  part of the reason why there is a sexual connotation here is in the eye of the beholder.
Theoretical limits of modeling particles in the universe.	theoretically speaking, if methuselah lived long enough and had enough clay tablets he could perform all of the calculations necessary to model all of the particles in the universe.	it is like writing down the equations necessary to cause a rocket ship to fly to the moon, then being baffled when it just sits motionless on the launchpad.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	again, i completely agree.
Training dogs for different purposes.	dogs can be trained to smell cancer, sense danger, lead the blind or disabled, or simply do a number of amusing tricks.	i want to be able to go away for a few days and only have to ask someone to come around once a day to feed my cat rather than stay with it.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	he had it.
Effectiveness of Advertising.	i have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.	what pop do you get ? some brand you never heard of or coke ? noticed that you can list of bud, coors and miller off the top of your head what happened to heineken ?.
Negotiating fair payment for services/goods.	the service/goods someone is providing exceeds the value of x dollars the buyer is offering.	this is the economy you are in.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	you started a business knowing full well what the tax implications of that were.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	but guns are not defensive against other guns.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	this is where the extremes come in and finding a balance, because at some point you could go to an extreme and tax someone so much that there would be a disincentive to having higher income if higher income is also connected to harder/more time consuming work for essentially no extra rewards.
Hunting and its impact on wildlife conservation.	hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence.	legally hunted animals are done so in a way that helps the environment.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	this describes calvinist beliefs which is not the most popular.
Success and Personal Capability	i am defining better here as how well equipped i am to be successful in achieving my goals in life.	either way, your worth as a human being is not contingent on making the money you want to make, solving the problems you want to solve, or being as healthy as you wish you were.
Parenting strategies.	the actual difficulty just comes from figuring out what kind of strategy you want to utilize to raise your kid.	i do not think you can say it is the hardest job in the world, but that idea that you come up with a plan and just stick to it is absurd.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	of course politicians and public figures will fight economic models and theories that challenge their platform, and news outlets will present multiple sides of a theory to appear unbiased and to generate viewership from the conflicting ideas, all regardless of whether or not the economic model in question is valid.
Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	google is definition URL is better, and i am not certain your claim that the definitions in merriam websters dictionary are  istandard  by any means.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	i am curious why you do not agree with the following very simple historical fact: in the past, when taxes on firms have been lowered or made ineffective , firms have been able to hire more people; that increased hiring increases productivity increases gdp and gni , decreases crime, people do not have to go elsewhere to survive and increases productive capital thus causing a positive externality for the tax cuts.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	similar to how in spain speaking with a lisp is correct, but english speakers see lisping as speech impediment.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	at least, if you are honestly skeptical about your own beliefs.
Sexual exclusivity in trust agreement.	why is sexual exclusivity part of the general trust agreeement ?	without a monogamous relationship, that is impossible.
Disadvantages of smoking and the issue of respect.	i ca not see any reason for a rational person to smoke.	i believe as a human being i have a right to do with my body as i see fit, and if that means using a stimulant to help deal with stress, then i will do just that.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	but thankfully this is absurd.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	when i get pho or japanese soup, they give you a spoon.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	consider new hire before tax cut: salary: , productivity: , tax liability: , company net: , recommendation: do not hire a change in the tax liability can change the  company net  to a positive and switch the recommendation to a do hire.
Sexual exclusivity in trust agreement.	why is sexual exclusivity part of the general trust agreeement ?	monogamy is a kind of gauge of trustworthiness.
Evaluation of Robert's Leadership Qualities.	and suffers from massive reality distortion field which gets him into fights he cannot win.	he is the rightful heir.
Advantages of Neutral and Fixed Money.	in particular, i see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.	which is more likely to happen ?.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	while i am hardly familiar with economics, i can only imagine it is a complicated system to comprehend.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	you make a good point and its worth clearing this up.
Drug use and altering one's state of mind.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	i want to learn about physics to alter my mind.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	i do not think this  problem  lies with the newer   better technologies, but rather with our relationship with them.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	basing itself on sacred scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that  homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.
Forced abortions and a woman's right to choose.	those who get pregnant without the three years minimum income would be subject to forced abortions.	on a pure gut level, i have to disagree with this sentence because i believe in a woman is right to choose: forced abortions are just as bad as making abortion illegal if not more so.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	would we have ever thought to go to the moon if we had not imagined going first ?.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	this is, admittedly, a risk, but with correct usage the failure rate of condoms is pretty low.
Eliminating the use of the word "potential" in reference to humans.	as a last point, what else, if not a human ?	sperm is also a stage in our lives.
Motivation for Suicide	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	and futile ? i fail to see how the result is not precisely something the individual once felt to be useful.
Income inequality and its effects on society.	in the countries which have the least income inequality the scandinavian countries and japan crime and poverty are reduced, but birth rates are unusually low and depression is high.	sure, sweden has more depression than iran, but then again, sweden has more diagnosed adhd, ptsd, ocd, and autism than iran as well.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	so i will just briefly address this:   i believe there is no god, no heaven and no hell.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	so you are saying that you would not voluntarily give away money if you did not agree with how that money was being spent ? i do not agree with every single thing when it comes to how government revenues are spent.
Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	it just feels wrong, you believe yourself to be a man, but you are constantly treated as a woman, and it just does not feel right.
Immorality of not paying taxes.	and if you do not participate fully, you are an immoral person ?	i am not sure what any of this has to do with the question of whether not paying taxes is immoral or not.
Effects of Spanking on Children's Thinking and Behavior	spanking does not encourage critical thinking: child a:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy will hit me  child b:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy explained x will happen.	i always listened to mom and grandma, always.
Affirmative Action Policy	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	a good affirmative action policy based on things like race or gender should be temporary and the purpose should not be to level the playing field directly.
Government compensation for descendants of slaves.	i believe detroit would be much more developed if black people received checks from the government.	how many black people in detroit already receive checks from the government from welfare programs ?.
Obesity and Bad Decision Making.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	it is not easy, but it is doable.
Human fetus and the use of the word "potential".	human fetus is a stage in the life of a human being.	technically, a fetus is a potential infant.
Gender identity and expression.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	it is not how they  feel  they should be it is about how they feel they  are.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	kids just have not developed the ability to think about consequences like they should e.
Password Security and Formula Usage.	ideally, passwords should not be reused, and a formula should be used to generate unique passwords for each account you have.	unless your  generation method  involves the use of outside info, like low significant digits of your gps coordinates at creation time.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	i am not sure what this means, either.
Theodicy and the problem of evil.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	how about god gave you reason, gave you choice, gave you freedom, and you decide what to do with it ? or i could conclude that god is so awesome, he gave us critical thinking and reason to do whatever we wanted, instead of just creating lemmings that follow the same pattern.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	this point seems strange.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	another error is that of thinking that entire categories of people are naturally superior to entire other categories, when regarding women and men this is a sexist assumption no matter which sex  wins,  because all members of a group will never be superior or inferior to all members of another group, at least regarding the sexes.
Tattoos and their significance.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	and i do not have any evidence, but my parents both grew up partially in african villages and i am fairly certain that people edit: removed would, changed to got got tattoos for the fuck of it there without any western influence.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	the ideal of, more or less, never having to worry about money again.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it has no weight on its own and only serves as framing for the next arguments.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	i do not know, maybe you have a plan, or those are just side interests and you have a business.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	i want to make the distinction that teaching someone is not managing the education for an entire society and that the practicality of learning something is not what is being questioned here.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	i like the open web too, but do i have a right to it ? well, i have already shown that the public  did  create the service, but importantly we are not talking about something that nearly everyone  uses  we are talking about something that nearly everyone  relies upon  in a very important way.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	it occurs when you try to analyse something repeatedly, but with no additional information.
Impact of British Empire on Third World and Hitler's Expansion Plans.	but the british empire was the largest and the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	hitler would not have simply been content to remain in germany he needed more land for the aryan race.
Relationship between religion and science.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.	i think the jesuits are reason enough that this opinion is not true.
Proof of God's existence through logic.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	what proof do you mean, specifically ?.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	all those little squares do is prevent you from getting syrup evenly distributed over your waffle, and if you want to try to do so, you would have to put enough syrup on them to make yourself sick.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	democrats fucked up too, and did so often.
Debate on punishment for criminals.	i hope we can generally all agree that people who destroy lives and threaten society should not be allowed to live among those of us who obey the law and contribute positively to society.	the subset who are  trying to vote  are subject to an even greater bias, with the most repentant and productive of them turning out to the polls.
Debate on the importance of animal species conservation.	i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	i think you are missing the how of it.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	i probably will try psychedelics at some point, but now is not my time for that.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	by not acknowledging the romantic part you debase homosexuality to just a sexual urge.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	they earned the respect of the people through there actions, and therefore earned there  honorifics.
Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	what i am about to suggest is something that would be considered not that big a deal here companies might grumble about it a bit but would probably cause us companies to riot: legislatively link any tax cuts to job creation/retention.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	bush, was born in .
Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	you should move somewhere closer to which pole you are already closest too, experience a real winter.
Inconsistencies in Wolverine's claws in different movies.	you remember at the end of the wolverine when logan loses his metal claws and regrows the cool as fuck bone claws ?	i think it is pretty clear that some amount of time has passed since the wolverine.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	the result is that fewer rapists actually get convicted than other violent criminals, and many victims hesitate to come forward, because they know that their character will be called into question in ways that may seriously damage their social status and career prospects.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	the metabolism of c plants becomes much less efficient with higher temperatures, which would mean much lower yields of less nutritious food.
The importance of mandatory writing courses in curriculum.	is there any reason at all to keep these courses in the curriculum, let alone mandatory ?	reading and writing more helps students become better writers.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	there are rest periods, but a soccer team is only allowed  substitutions over the course of the entire game.
The ideology of mathematics and physics.	the intellectual purity of mathematics and physics cannot be surpassed.	are completely ideological.
Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	the people accepted it, because they had no option.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	nobility is something passed down through family lines.
Difficulty of Combos and Lack of Advanced Techniques in a Game.	combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there is no l cancelling, wavedashing or other related high level techniques that can be used.	however, it would definitely be nice for the game to be more fair at times, to allow for competitive play even though most people who play it do not do so competitively.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	how can you say he would not get it done ? he is young yet, give him time.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	we say  i do not know  when it comes to unproven science.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	even if an understanding of large scale economics is not difficult to attain, that does not mean that every economist should have the same solution.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	no because the world always changes.
Physical effects of injury.	that is because the effects on the body can be physically scarring.	hurt hərt/submit verb .
Correlation between test scores and preparation methods.	however, there is a very strong correlation between act/sat scores and the amount of time/money put into preparing for them.	however, i think that just means we need to do some research to figure out how to improve the questions.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	the real reason you should not mind is because the issue is far bigger than you.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	people are presented with several lifestyle options and will go for the one that suits them best, without hurting or interfering with other is lives.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	you started a business knowing full well what the tax implications of that were.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	i would argue that every adult   who has sex with a kid  is using their age advantage, mainly because they are mentally not on the same playing field as the kid.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	let is leave aside beliefs about a specific afterlife for a minute.
Philosophy and Science's Relationship.	many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.	that means you are not allowed to use logic or rhetoric.
Men's primary concern: Romantic Love.	men, however  do  have romantic love as their primary concern.	again, can you tell us where you are coming from ? personal experience ? some set of statistics ? it obviously ca not be the portrayal of men or women in the media because you are arguing  against  those stereotypes being accurate.
Offensive policies and societal reactions to offense.	i understand finding racial profiling or stop and frisk offensive, policies that actually impact your life that are sanctioned by the state.	you can eat what you like.
Debate on the role of evidence in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	both are second hand sources they could be lying, or mistaken or deluded, or trying to trick you ultimately you only have  your own  evidence as a first hand source of what to believe of not to believe.
Parental Influence and Gender Roles.	similarly, two fathers ca not breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods.	and pressure ? yeah, parents pressure children to do lots of things.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	we will no longer inherit the good genes because the designers wo not put the  good  stuff in there to be passed on even if it were recessive.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	it is about having people that love you in your life, or spend there whole lives with one person.
Fear of death and afterlife beliefs.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	i cant turn on the light all i can tell you is there is no reason to be afraid and no reason to assume there is monsters.
The challenges of relationships and breakups.	not to mention becoming emotionally compromised if a break up were to occur.	it is the ultimate failure.
Trade with countries lacking freedom, justice, and equality.	why should developed countries trade with countries which have a lack of freedom, justice, and equality ?	yet you still feel it ok to trade with them.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	children growing up in, say, creationist homes or muslim faith schools will be simply scientifically illiterate when they reach adulthood, preventing thousands of possible scientists and engineers from ever progressing.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	art is a reflection of where we are, science can paint a direction of where we are going.
Eliminating the use of the word "potential" in reference to humans.	as a last point, what else, if not a human ?	are sperm humans ? even a fertilized egg may not be human molar pregnancies.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	especially to those of your faith although, that being said, speaking to those that do not share your faith is often very enlightening too.
Testing humans and God's omniscience in "Men in Black".	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	so, see god is all knowingness like griffin from mib he does not see just one outcome, he sees  all  of them.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	the idea of free will is in contrast to the idea of the  futility  of human will  you want to teach kids that their choices and actions are futile ? the common man does not have an acknowledged definition, but he does have an understanding of what it is and means it is the sensation  i am doing this ! i choose this it is me i am the cause, not something else, and it is up to me to choose a or b.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	terrible.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	then i assume you also have issues with the overtime structure for the regular season for the nhl and the nfl.
Forced abortions and a woman's right to choose.	those who get pregnant without the three years minimum income would be subject to forced abortions.	if you go a little deeper on that path, you have to consider whether or not people have the right of family planning in general.
The influence of colors, images, and words on the human mind.	the human mind is highly susceptible to being influenced by colors, images and words.	i think they should be forced to provide information about there product ingredients, calories.
Correlation between test scores and preparation methods.	however, there is a very strong correlation between act/sat scores and the amount of time/money put into preparing for them.	what is more important is the quality of your education up to that point, which is affected by a lot of factors time you are able to spend on schoolwork, understanding of the english language, family/friends emphasis on school, willingness and ability to memorize, etc.
Character description.	instead he chose the way of evil magic and became a kinslayer.	you do not need to be someone is best friend, you just need their respect.
Taxation and Wealth Redistribution for Large Corporations.	firstly, higher tax rates for large corporations would redistribute wealth in society, without greatly affecting the rich individuals in question.	you have to solve their long history of civil wars and corruption.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	being a  good person  has a positive impact on other human beings.
The problem of evil in philosophy.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	unfortunately there has never been a perfectly satisfactory answer to this problem.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	i think it depends on what your needs and objectives are.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	so all we need to do to avoid an oligarchy is not elect people from the same families ? i had no idea it was so easy.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	it is not up to me to decide for others what is right for them unless they are my responsibility   that is pure hubris imo.
Individuality and Equal Opportunity in Society	i do not want the same as others, i want a chance to fulfill my own dreams and objectives.	there is nothing inherently wrong with order.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	it is hardly time wasted when you enjoyed it.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	if the basis of one is morality is one is own integrity, then it is the easiest choice in the world: you do not push the button.
Baker refusing to make cake for polygamous marriage.	what if a baker refused to make a cake for a polygamous marriage ?	there are just cakes and the gay people who buy them for whatever purpose they want.
Benefits of being single vs being in a relationship.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	if you are happy being alone, i suppose it is fine.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	as someone who suffers from misophonia, it makes it unbearable for me to sit near people who are doing that, and there is no objective reason why people should not try to be more quiet when they eat.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	there is no evidence whatsoever that men are inherently more competitive without the influence of society.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	they are contrary to the natural law.
Reducing genetic diversity.	i do not consider reduction of genetic diversity a real problem.	this may not be a moral imperative as disease is, but i for one would do it every time.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	a position i do agree with you on ! rudeness is inherently subjective, and some may attempt to write something humorous or witty while another may read it just as rude.
Atheism as a belief or doctrine.	c the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	again, this involves a non standard redefinition of a word.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	we can be agnostic in the sense that a god may exist, but atheistic because no current understanding of god is convincing.
Collective action and political influence for social change.	the people can collectively rise up and overthrow those with unjust power.	can you clarify this for me ? well, i think that those are hard to start because they are expensive, and most people do not have that kind of money.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	quite a lot of sexual assault happens because people are afraid to go against what appears to be mainstream behaviour.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	where have you been for the past several years ?.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	regular money itself is a bunch of bits of paper and metal and also, mostly ones and zeros.
Tipping and servers' wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	being a waiter/waitress is one of the most rewarding jobs there is when compared to the other jobs available which require no education.
Testing humans and God's omniscience in "Men in Black".	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	if not, bear with me.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	there is no motivation to do homework that is so far beneath them they could do it in their sleep.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	tobacco is one of the most addictive drugs on the market, consistant with cocaine and heroin.
Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	the bottom line is that the importance of these issues may vary from person to person, but everyone has a right to focus on whatever issues they want to.
Human adaptability and survival.	humans will simply adapt and move on, we are an incredibly resourceful species and have collectively survived or overcome every single challenge posed to us.	if certain animals go extinct, it could have very bad effects on the ecosystems, therefore harming us.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	you will need to identify them in particular for the rest of us to grasp which ones you are talking about.
Difficulty of Combos and Lack of Advanced Techniques in a Game.	combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there is no l cancelling, wavedashing or other related high level techniques that can be used.	but in general, these issues of combos, glitches, and slow physics are fairly silly complaints, because the game was not really designed to accommodate them.
Inappropriate clothing and sexualization of girls.	in my opinion these types of shorts reveal way to much.	what i am hearing from you is that seeing girls dressed in this way leads you to associate them with the concept of sex in your mind, and this makes you feel uncomfortable and guilty.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	people who display confidence are often ignorant or at least preventing themselves from learning more, while those that celebrate and reward confidence are actively enabling this primitive behavior.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	as long as  things  have an intrinsic value attached to them, we as humans are going to want to maximise the acquisition of that value so that we can, ideally, know that we will be able to get those  things  whenever we want.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	people like these subjects because they very passionate and romantic, but certainly there are many other poems out there as well.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	i am often gone from the house, and work irregular hours and do not have a yard.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	he has attempted to redefine what skeptic means.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	so pardon me if i diverge somewhat from yours.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	human rights extending to people who have something that you want, or who are your enemy, is a fairly recent concept.
Criticism of libertarianism's impact on poverty and prejudice.	libertarianism leads to more poverty, blocks the prevention of racism and other prejudice, and ensures that poor people have little hope of escaping their plight.	did you know that gay marriage and abortion on demand were part of the libertarian party is official policy as early as  ? another utterly baseless assumption  i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	there product should have nutritional information, and that is enough.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	the problem is not that we do not question the accuser, in other words, it is that we tend to drag the accuser through the muck in a way that we do not with other crimes.
Origins and significance of "Deutschlandlied"	deutschlandlied is a song of unity, peace, and brotherhood from the very first stanza.	i ca not imagine an austrian would feel comfortable hearing the first stanza because the first stanza, taken to its logical conclusion, extols the virtues of austrians and other european countries with a substantial german population becoming part of germany because by german, they mean german the ethnicity not german the nationality.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	it is not that high standards are inherently bad, but a lot of individuals who bandy them about are simultaneously not living up to their own standards for themselves e.
Controversy surrounding the use of the word "redskin"	first off when has anyone every heard the word redskin outside of talking about the professional football team ?	has anyone used the word redskin out of hate ? this book URL has some good examples of historical usage, and yes, in many of these examples it is used out of hate.
Comparison of science and religion in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	but for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	confidence inspires you to find out the ways in which you might be wrong.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	badass women certainly existed, but were a general anomaly.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	or they might just never bump in to you by sheer chance.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	in fact, the government attempted to sell off the research project to a bunch of private companies which all declined to buy it.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	but i feel like you are kinda of comparing apples to orange.
Controversy over offensive sports team names.	while i understand why a team name like  redskins  is a bigoted name, i do not understand why people get offended over something so inconsequential.	if you understand why the name is bigoted, why do not you understand why people would be offended ? would you understand why people would be offended if the name of the team was the  niggers  and their mascot was a golliwogg stereotype ? keep in mind here,  understanding why someone else is offended  by the name is different from  you yourself personally being offended  by the name.
Zero tolerance policy in schools	i also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who ca not solve problems on their own.	i am not anti violence, per sé: i believe in the necessity of a warrior culture.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	when in doubt i believe it is best to assume good faith, however even then engaging something which is just fractally wrong, or worse not even wrong, can become tiresome.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	this was a route to failure.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	understand the nature of this fear as possibly being a test of your character.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	if your problem is that people who  get in early  make huge profits, this is no different than what investors do for any organization.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	they close the sexual act to the gift of life.
Physical effects of injury.	that is because the effects on the body can be physically scarring.	that does not make it any worse.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	the longer we fail to do something, the harder it becomes until the point of impossibility to just eliminate any future change, much less reverse that change.
Raising the driving age and preventing texting while driving.	i think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	i have no idea how driving a car causes drinking and illegal drug use.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	the were designed to cast a large net.
Criticism of modern art and its value.	nothing of cultural or practical value is produced.	the best we can do is gain some core general knowledge, specialize, and then hope for the best.
Gender identity and expression.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	there was an article about lana wachowski is transition from male to female where she talked about how when she was in school the boys and girls would have separate queues for lunch and she would have trouble knowing which one she should join because even though she was a  boy  she felt like she should be joining the girls queue.
Opinions on Donald Trump's wife, Melania.	but more importantly she does not appear like gold digger, she feels she earned everything with work.	i think you have to respect a person like that.
Theodicy and the problem of evil.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	if you read the book of genesis, you will see that he even performed some of these things noah is ark anyone ? there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	i do not think it is at all unreasonable to be angry or offended by chipotle is decision to prohibit lawful carriers from dining in their restaurant.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	and that is the naivete at play, that a disarmed populace means less violent crime.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	conservatively speaking, it is better not to.
Implications of the US government's actions on an individual.	with all of the world watching, how could the us government do anything to him ?	they may disagree with the decision, but that is about it.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	yes, only that we could be one of those species that did not make it, or we could be thrown back into the stone age.
Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	you will never resolve them if you continue acting like everybody else is the problem, which is sort of ironic because that same attitude it is the bedrock of the anti fat shaming movement.
Subjectivity of Monetary Value and Understanding Price Determination Systems.	that is, i think that monetary value is inherently subjective and that we do not usefully understand the systems that determine the price of a good, or an appropriate salary for work performed.	the same applies to people who is work is effectively a good that is traded between companies.
Training dogs for different purposes.	dogs can be trained to smell cancer, sense danger, lead the blind or disabled, or simply do a number of amusing tricks.	my cat can leave anytime she wants to.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	if you are going to want to be with someone who is put in effort into something, then while it is not necessarily always a requirement it is  better  if you have something to offer or are willing to put in some effort into stuff yourself.
Gender equality in front line warfighting jobs.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	equality of outcome URL.
Equality and Individuality	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	in this situation, i do not hire someone because they cannot physically perform the job just like i would not hire a paraplegic.
Islamophobia and stereotyping of Muslims.	a militant group is murdering innocent civilians and trying to enforce a backwards, sexist legal system ?	you just described the salem witch trials URL which were carried out by puritanical christians.
Debate on the definition of atheism.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	i see patterns throughout world religions, rooted in natural law, and tend to agree with adi shankara and his concept of brahman.
Eliminating the use of the word "potential" in reference to humans.	as a last point, what else, if not a human ?	technically, a fetus is a potential infant.
Theoretical limits of modeling particles in the universe.	theoretically speaking, if methuselah lived long enough and had enough clay tablets he could perform all of the calculations necessary to model all of the particles in the universe.	what you seem to be saying is that it is impossible to create a perfect simulation, but i am not sure why you believe that.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	i suggest having a look at how the definitions vary between dictionaries.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	gnostic atheism is making a specific claim that no god exists.
***Topic: The irrationality of atheism.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	that is not the topic, the irrationality of atheism is.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	so popular religious beliefs, if they do anything, put  more  blame on the individual, there is no escape from responsibility.
The influence of colors, images, and words on the human mind.	the human mind is highly susceptible to being influenced by colors, images and words.	as long as they do not promise anything false, than it is fine.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	if you do not have brain activity, you are not perceiving anything.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	no we could not.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	i write because i love to immerse myself and discover all the vivid and magical details of which this universe has to offer me.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	the first interactions that made us human were not tool making: it was the telling and passing down of the story.
The reality of military service.	so, with that wrapped up, i figure i can spice up my life a little. some adventure, no ?	have you thought about the peace corps ? non profit development work in third world countries ?.
Relationship between religion and science.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.	it is effective as an organizing force.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	what is the point of going to a church if it is not a community that can help you when you need it ? death is hard to deal with.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	for what it is worth, some native americans, myself included, try to avoid feelings of bitterness.
The importance of science in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	also odd that literacy is a direct cause of people wanting to read the bible, torah, and qu ran.
Atheism as Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	one must be convinced.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	and there are just as many boomer politicians on the other side wanting a restoration of certain policies and laws.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	lastly, do you think that all coders should learn/know fortran ? it is the  basic  programming language, yet i can promise you that most of the apps/programs/games you use are created by people that have no idea how to use fortran.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	even if you could build something, you would not have anyone to make money from and you would not have the infrastructure to access potential customers in a society.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	if something is unknowable, then there can exist no evidence, thus why be agnostic.
Affirmative action and merit-based scholarships.	i believe that all scholarships should be merit based, and while many are, some schools that have to fill  race quotas  to  diversify the campus  in the process, ignore more qualified students in favor of the correctly colored one.	the goal should be to change expectations.
Israeli aggression towards neighboring countries.	israel has been continually attacking their neighbours for more land or cause a weakening mayhem upon them; lebanon, syria, iraq soon iran.	evidence ? actually the opposite is true, but i doubt you understand.
Comparison of federal government services to companies and state institutions.	the federal government is better at services than any company or state institution can be.	are federal prisons less violent than state prisons ? you have simply assumed this without justification.
Misconceptions about the LGBTQ+ community.	or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	you ca not be pressured into being gay and being gay is not a lifestyle.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	to me the fact that you have likely benefited from tax dollars in each of the life experiences you have described, is an indication that lawful taxation is a good thing.
Withdrawal from Cannabis Classification on Website	while withdrawal from cannabis has absolutely no drawbacks.	i used to be heavily dependent on marijuana.
Freedom of speech and the use of the word "oriental"	now i was just wondering why we ca not say the word oriental.	should not that be enough ? it does not matter if you can or not; most of them do not want to be referred to in that way.
Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	should not that be enough ? it does not matter if you can or not; most of them do not want to be referred to in that way.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	this has less to do with the boomers, but is still something they have failed to react to.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	therefore, a  well regulated militia  is a militia that is performing its function ie: being a defensive force for the homeland of the country  they are a tool designed specifically for killing, unlike the other two.
Teaching children about lies and authority figures.	l kids, or that spiderman exists, or that daniel radcliff really is a wizard.	do you even know how to teach people to think cricitally ? it is not telling them lies.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	gender is not equivalent to biological chromosomal definitions what you are referring to as biological sex.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	he was not an unreasonable man, and gave amnesty to the tyrells and stormlanders who changed allegiance after renly is assassination.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	i think he is if he knew full well that the person he was having sex with was married with children.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	you may feel this way, but the people who have casual sex clearly do not.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	tl;dr mass education is bullshit.
Criticism of Anti-Poaching Initiative.	anti pouching initiative is hypocrisy in itself.	poachers have no interest in maintaining a healthy population, unlike the groups that set hunting seasons and limits.
Bad decision making and quitting smoking.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	wouldnt there be public outrage ? are we not, in either case, making it seem like bad life choices are permissible ? there is a difference between  action  and  consequence.
Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	say you wake up tomorrow, go to your bathroom and a woman is face is looking back at you.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	stubenville is a good example.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	it will be more effort to modify your dna to fit the standard, than to just copy the standard with a variety of options.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	it may have something to do with the fact that both my parents have hyperactive thyroids, but either way, i admit that it is a little unfair that i do not get the same derision for my  lifestyle.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	a person may commit suicide while having no concern or even perception for how it may affect anyone else.
Libertarianism and Social Liberalism	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	it has been proven to work.
Disagreeing with Webster's Dictionary and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.	disagreeing with webster is dictionary and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.	this is silly and irrelevant, some sort of bizarre false analogy not worth exploring.
Sex as a reward for being a good person.	there is a common idea that for men perhaps for women as well, but moreso for men , sex and love are rewards for being a good person.	jumping immediately to intercourse is a hasty generalization on your part.
Subjectivity of opinions on musicians and people.	there are loads of better musicians and many more interesting people.	simply being able to name what  you  think is a more talented band does not mean the beatles were not talented and influential.
Misconceptions about Science and Evolution.	humanity is understanding of science, particularly of biology and physics, are hopelessly incorrect on almost every level.	the actual reliable, repeatable experiments have zero need for evolution to make sense of it, and more often challenge evolution imo.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	now, maybe everyone picks their own ideal from the spread of hollywood folks, but in my experience, personality seems to win hearts more than physical appearance.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	why do you think this is objectively better this way ? would it be terrible if a woman raised you and you gained difference insights and learned different skills ? just because you happened to be shaped by these experiences how do you know if your life turned out differently without a father how do you know this would be a bad thing ? also, do not you think there is something to be said about you as an individual and what your unique abilities and strengths and weaknesses are ? if you happened to be raised by two mothers how different would you be really ?.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	but culture surrounds in all different types and forms.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	long story short, people are people, you meet a different subset of them online.

Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	this list goes on.
Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	was he wholly negative about it like you are, or was he simply disinterested in excuses and otherwise encouraging towards people who  wanted  to work to get in shape ? because how many people are motivated by any kind of shitty  fuck you  attitude, really ? if your friend was a body builder and you just copied him, that presumably means at one point you were the fat guy at the gym, the same people you laugh at for being weak.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	which is not what agnosticism does, it just pretends that because they believe its unknowable, oddly enough a claim which they often express knowledge of, that it is somehow a superior position to rejection of said claim until there is evidence.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	if you are interested in this christian creation story, i would recommend reading  the lost world of genesis one  by john walton.
Discussion about a losing war and betrayal of a leader.	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	his mother removes the most critical asset robb had in the war, and he essentially slaps her on the wrist for it his mother was also the reason the riverlands sided with robb, and his only shot at potentially getting the vale.

Criticism of Libertarianism and Government Monopolies.	i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.	i promise if you actually research you will find government intervention leads to more poverty and blocks the prevention of racism who was it who installed the jim crow laws again ? oh right.

Challenges of using chopsticks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	as someone who suffers from misophonia, it makes it unbearable for me to sit near people who are doing that, and there is no objective reason why people should not try to be more quiet when they eat.
Character description.	instead he chose the way of evil magic and became a kinslayer.	he had it.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	if you want that experience you could do it with something less horrible for your body, and less addicting.

Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	why should an nhl team be allowed to play a mini game to determine who goes to the playoffs ? why should an nfl game end in a tie instead of determining a winner ? also, i should point out, in soccer there is only a shootout in a deciding game elimination/knockout games.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	maybe woman are not as effective as men as front line warfighters, maybe men deserve more thorough screening in child care.

Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	a homosexual relationship encompasses, love, friendship, romance, non sexual intimacy and yes sex.

Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	if you propose a god that is deceptive and creates things like a  mature universe , then it is also unprovable.
Criticism of modern art and its value.	nothing of cultural or practical value is produced.	and physics is not ? how many different interpretations of quantum mechanics URL are there again ? tell me how practical the properties of the monster group URL are for my everyday life.

Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	the preamble says that the federal government was formed to  in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  URL as such, the federal government has the power to address all of those issues.

Islamophobia and stereotyping of Muslims.	a militant group is murdering innocent civilians and trying to enforce a backwards, sexist legal system ?	yup, it is totally a problem unique to islam.
Islamophobia and stereotyping of Muslims.	a militant group is murdering innocent civilians and trying to enforce a backwards, sexist legal system ?	or the spanish inquisition URL for that matter.
Reducing genetic diversity.	i do not consider reduction of genetic diversity a real problem.	if i could make my child smarter, faster, clear skinned, better vision, taller, etc.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	it would no longer be possible to live in most of the world without advanced technology, it would be simply too hot to live.
The importance of mandatory writing courses in curriculum.	is there any reason at all to keep these courses in the curriculum, let alone mandatory ?	the rubrics just say does well/does poorly, with the mark left completely up to the teacher is discretion.

Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	for some reason, i doubt that a company like walmart with a $ billion net profit needs more money to hire people.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	if you are stuck in the corporeal world, you must deal with the realities of that.
Grades and job preparedness.	students are coddled and are not prepared for when grades do not exist and their jobs are at stake.	however, is that what is happening here ? we know the percentage of a is has recently risen.

Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	given that most of congress is made up by those of advanced age, i fail to see how anyone can make the argument that the baby boomers had any kind of policy making power in the  is.
Fear of Eternal Sleep.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	you will fancy the idea more if you suffer for a year or so to the point, and way beyond the point, where you just want it to stop.

Genetic modification of non-disease traits in children.	but i would go farther to even argue that non disease traits should be altered by parents to give children better outcomes.	you know those parents who always wanted to be a great musician or a great athelete, so they pressure their kid to spend hours in practice ? and even if the kid turns out successful as a programmer or something, the parent is still disappointed that they did not get the star qb son they wanted ? now imagine that the parent paid a large sum of money to genetically engineer the kid to be a perfect doctor or football player or whatever.
Empirical verification of God's existence through various methods.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	evidence of god is frequently achieved be it via ecstatic spiritual experience or logic, innate knowledge or etc , and is likely replicable via proper experimentation a life of prayer and contemplation, love for god   neighbor, yoga / meditation, entheogens, nde is and death, for instance.

Benefits of being single vs being in a relationship.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	you should be in a relationship for the journey and not the destination.
Parental Influence and Gender Roles.	similarly, two fathers ca not breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods.	two mothers could not have nearly that kind of impact on me.

Equality and Individuality	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	the reason i choose to hire/not hire someone has nothing to do with their gender even though women are generally less strong than men.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	it instead allows the people who have nothing better to do than practice their fighting skills and violent use of non gun weapons ie: criminals to overpower the law abiding citizens, unless the police happens to be around and care.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	that is just one of many examples of how you ca not argue all or many religions are true.

Prescription refills and time constraints.	what if you do not have time to the doctor ?	if the individual is poor at planning and habitually misses doses or scheduling appointments or refilling scripts, there are other alternatives: depo provera injections, mirena iud, nuvaring, nexplanon/implanon subdermal implant, and etc.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	do you really believe that you can possibly comprehend the reality of what an afterlife would entail ? if you believe the god created the entire universe and every amazing thing in it of which we have the tiniest sliver of knowledge of, and it is still mindblowingly amazing then you have to think that somewhere described as paradise would be even more amazing than that.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	at least, if you are honestly skeptical about your own beliefs.
Philosophical Writing	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	the end result, then, is not something that can be distilled into a thesis statement, but is rather a web of linked ideas that extend far beyond the page and have the potential to encompass every human thought and experience.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	and the moral atheist does well to appropriate it.
The reality of military service.	so, with that wrapped up, i figure i can spice up my life a little. some adventure, no ?	anything non combat related is essentially grunt work in terrible, inhospitable places.
Outrage culture and privilege.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	to let it go unaddressed lends credence to the statement.
Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	and to the extent that you are projecting and, from my armchair, i really think you are you should really just thrust that onto yourself instead of using other people as an outlet for your self esteem issues.
Equality and Discrimination.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	maybe i am just angry for being yelled at for holding the door for a random chick but seriously, what is so wrong with different treatment, as long as it is short of malicious discrimination ? people are not the same, but like i said variation within the sexes is at least if not greater.
Libertarianism and Social Liberalism	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	democrats and republicans are the ones with illegitimate, emotional viewpoints, as they base everything on  should be  rather than  what is.
Smoking and Suicide Prevention	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	demonizing them will not make many quit; it may even exacerbate underlying issues that led them to smoke in the first place.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	now if your concern is the  greater fool  style of investing, where you buy something useless to pass along to a greater fool later on for more money, that does not seem accurate here.
Opinions on tattoos as a superficial trend.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	this to me is a strange interpretation of a tattoo of a person is child.
Foreign aid and small business support in Africa.	i also feel more money should be spent on foreign aid, especially in the form of small business support in africa, for example.	you would need to end the tribal conflicts.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	that is what most atheists do.
The obsession with sports players in American culture.	americans fetishize players in order to keep the masses obsessing over the nostalgia attached with players.	? so we want to have a championship or else we are suffering ? is not that being a fairweather fan about ? only one team in a league can win a championship a year, so every other team is fan is suffering and not worthy of a team is loyalty ? really ? there are long streaks of losing in the us of popular clubs URL and college football is insanely huge but people do not switch loyalties because their team does not win.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	which shoots a hole in your base premise that the internet is a private industry that came from private research and private investment.
Cultural disintegration in a globalized world.	with the world becoming more and more of a melting pot, cultures seem to be disintegrating.	it seems disingenuous to note only what you perceive as negative influences.
Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	same thing happened with  negro , which is why it is generally a poor idea to call blacks negros in the us at least.
Existence of God and Problem of Evil.	i can only conclude that there either is no god, or that there is a god not worthy of admiration and praise.	i am a fan of plantinga is free will defense URL.
Causes of WWII and Lebensraum concept.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	how familiar are you with the concept of  lebensraum  ? wwii did not start just because those poor germans wanted the danzig corridor.

Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	i have to disagree with you here because i believe it is a combination of both, but also neither depending on how you describe it.
Comparing effects of cannabis and alcohol use.	cannabis also mellows you out, makes you more relaxed and heightens the imagination and improves creativity.	i am not sure if i would advocate for schools to teach  pro weed , but i think schools should definitely go over the cons of the drug.
Inconsistencies in Wolverine's claws in different movies.	you remember at the end of the wolverine when logan loses his metal claws and regrows the cool as fuck bone claws ?	he is now more powerful than ever with no reason given ! you remember the after credits scene where he was using his power to move the chess piece ? the cure was not permanent.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	supernatural things do not exist, and the word describes something that violates our understanding of nature.
Chopsticks and their practicality.	but for practically everything else, there is just no god damn reason to use chopsticks when western utensils are more practical, and better for the environment.	therefore, instruments used for killing must be banned from the dining table, and that is why chinese food is always chopped into bite size before it reaches the table.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	there are provable gods out there, but none have been proven.
Misconceptions about men's rights and pick-up artist communities.	i am completely comfortable lumping all these groups men is rights, pick up artistry, the red pill, puahate together.	there is also zero evidence linking elliot rodger to the mrm.

Identifying personal strengths.	my strengths lie in literature and english.	a lot of people said they hate math, but love physics, as physics is a more direct application of math.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	it is easy for someone to say:  things were good when clinton or bush was president, i will vote for another one.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	i like that in a pet, it is something i do not really get from dogs.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	poland would have given up the path to the sea if britain did not give them the war guarantee.

Evaluation of Robert's Leadership Qualities.	and suffers from massive reality distortion field which gets him into fights he cannot win.	he had it.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	we would also end up with a temperature of several hundred degrees celsius, and an atmosphere that is about  times denser than we have now, meaning every living thing on this planet would die.

The Thomistic Perspective on Homosexuality and Natural Law.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	what you are describing is the so called  perverted faculty  argument of natural law.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	the harsh truth is, that your view of sweden and its people is a charicature, not at all accurate with the reality, and that you are stereotyping them; and this stereotype is based on your perception of whatever goes on in sweden, not necessarily the truth.

Limiting voting rights to educated individuals.	not allowing uneducated people to vote would also reduce the influence of racism and other popular yet often incorrect opinions.	someone with a fulltime job would not do that research, even with a college level education.

Purpose of affirmative action for disadvantaged students.	the intent behind the affirmative action is certainly well meaning, aimed at helping needy students.	why do you think this is the purpose of affirmative action ? its purpose is to give historically disadvantaged kids a better shot at getting in.
Debate on the morality of homosexuality.	that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	i would argue that sexual pleasure can actually be good for a person.
Outdated beliefs and animal population control.	the archaic belief in people returning to life, and even the belief that dead would feel insulted if not  properly respected  is outdated and a fallacy.	the environment is constantly shifting and adjusting and there is no good reason to put a stamp on our current situation and claim it to be a  proper  balance.
Chopsticks and their practicality.	but for practically everything else, there is just no god damn reason to use chopsticks when western utensils are more practical, and better for the environment.	however, chopsticks reflect gentleness and benevolence, the main moral teaching of confucianism.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	but the only way to end gun violence is to treat guns the way we currently treat marijuana another issue entirely : search and destroy.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	they want to help others as much as the next person, they just do not think that the federal government is generally the best way to do that.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	the fact that you can understand something is not sufficient to have it happen.
Atheism and the Afterlife	i believe there is no god, no heaven and no hell.	i completely agree with this but completely disagree with your conclusion.
Awareness of Jesus and religious persecution during the Holocaust.	obviously every single adult in a western country has heard of jesus already, and has had the opportunity to convert.	again, how the hell would they know that at  fake street, some guy who has not seen his girlfriend needs to be harassed ? they did not know ! cut them a little slack on that one.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	for reference, i am using the acs website URL as my source.
Chopstick etiquette and usage.	i do realize that chopsticks are more appropriate for a few select foods.	actually, the chinese were taught to use chopsticks long before spoons and forks were invented in europe the knife is older, not as an instrument for dining but as weapon.
Income inequality and its effects on society.	in the countries which have the least income inequality the scandinavian countries and japan crime and poverty are reduced, but birth rates are unusually low and depression is high.	why is that an inherently bad thing ? birth rates have more to do with the technical ability of contraception, than with the happiness of a population.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	if the government is allowed to mobilize the army against the population for this right, what other rights will they go after once this one has been taken ? do not just say that the current administration or whoever wo not abuse the power.
Pizza sizes and confusion.	my point is that when places like dominos and pizza hut sell you s, m, l pies, you have no way to know what you are getting.	this actually is not the case as all.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	this alternative is much worse.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	misplaced confidence is the problem.
The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	that is inarguable.
Career interests and strengths in literature and English.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	many people struggle with different topics, the point is to overcome them.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	tldr; you can get that cool factor other ways, cigs will fuck you up.
Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	company wants a tax cut above and beyond what they would normal get then they have to create new positions and keep people in those jobs to sustain those tax cuts.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	we have come so very far in such a very short time.
Identity and the effects of drugs/alcohol on perception.	i have observed that while high/drunk users exhibit and/or report that their emotions, perceptions, thought processes, behavior, and memory are altered, if only temporarily.	beyond the continuous physical form, how else is one to define the self than by those very qualities ? the main issue here is probably your confusion over a person is identity.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	some of what you have said is just misinformed, some is wrong, and some might cause a bsod upon reading.
Parental Influence and Gender Roles.	similarly, two fathers ca not breastfeed a baby or teach girls about periods.	bullying is wrong.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	why would you be judged ? who does that ? not true.
Government's role in marriage.	which made me ask, why the government was even involved in marriage in the first place.	yes, they do exist at the government is behest.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	every character but walter white is a trope, and the story becomes very predictable about midway through season .
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	taxing is not a negative value being placed on you, its simply taking a portion of a reward.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	imagine a home invader armed with a knife.
Comparison of regular birth control pills and Plan B.	why should regular daily pill birth control be any different ?	then there are lesser risks to life and limb, like different degrees of bleeding.
Dangers of texting while driving.	texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	not just adults.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	nearly  of the federal budget goes to things like medicare and social security.
Philosophy and Science's Relationship.	many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.	tell me how modern science is going to solve the problem of induction, i would love to know.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	this is just a straw man argument.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	it is not like you are  not  going to date them in real life.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	further: rather than maximizing employment, the goal of a company is generally to maximize profit.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	and teaching a girl about a period ? why not ? is it impossible for a man to have any information or knowledge about the process ? i guess all the male gynecologists and obstetricians do not exist in your world.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	you can spend bitcoin now at thousands of places.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	it also has the same problem as syrup, but personally, i like a lot of peanut butter so it is not a problem for me, but some people like a nice thin layer.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	there is no way this is better, or logistically feasible.
Atheism as a non-belief or non-doctrine.	the claim that atheism is not a belief or a doctrine.	every additional belief, including there are no gods , is not essential.
Inappropriate clothing and sexualization of girls.	in my opinion these types of shorts reveal way to much.	at such an impressionable age, how do you think this will impact her social development ? will worrying about trying to control what is happening in others  minds lead her towards confidence, healthy relationships, and success, or will it instead lead her down the path of blaming herself for her partner is abuse and infidelity ? if she were to be sexually abused, would she keep it a secret because she felt guilty for causing the thoughts that lead to that abuse ? you see, going down this path does not eliminate the sexual guilt you feel; it simply shifts the burden of that guilt onto the girls.
Anti-Semitic sentiment during wartime.	hostilities against the jews were more intense because of the war.	to say that he  only wanted a route to the sea  is really naive and frankly ridiculous, he already had one URL hitler did not need poland, he wanted poland for because in mein kamph he promised germany the entirety of eastern europe, which was one of the major tennents of mein kamph URL signaling his intentions well before any pact between poland and britain was accorded.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	he would then be renly is heir renly could make the best of the situation by backing stannis, and then all of that good stuff happens.
Job satisfaction and career aspirations.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	and you should follow that.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	at this stage it is very unlikely they have the capacity to understand the full implications of whatever they did.
The deception of Santa Claus.	there is a real feeling that you have been lied to, because well you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.	i was not, but then again, i was piss poor and santa was a bit inconsistent.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	everyone is aware that most people who have hit puberty want to have sex, even though some adults might deny knowing it.
Debate on the definition of atheism.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	that seems disingenuous at best.
The deception of Santa Claus.	there is a real feeling that you have been lied to, because well you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.	you make it sound it is like your partner confessing to cheating on you.
Anti-Semitic sentiment during wartime.	hostilities against the jews were more intense because of the war.	URL this is besides the point though, hitler invaded poland after he had already been given the czech republic and austria.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	young kittens, maybe.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	put it this way most people who want a relationship have an ideal in mind.
Negative effects of participation trophies on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	no matter the age or their position in life, it is important to people to feel appreciated for what they do if they are to continue doing it.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	many seas would be devoid of life.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	it makes you ready.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	for your idea that people will just stop:   about  of smokers say they want to quit and about half try to quit each year, but only  to  succeed without help.
Atheism as Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	another point of evidence against this position is the ubiquity of spirituality across cultures and time.
Clarifying the distinction between hard and soft atheism.	atheists often dispute that these are separate categories, speaking of hard and soft atheism.	a person can be an atheist because it is a less complex assumption, that a universe with out a god is simpler than a universe with a god, and see no advantage to asserting the existence of one.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	what is grinkle grokked from ? a.
Comparison of eating habits between smokers and non-smokers.	i think the difference is mostly visceral, and stems from the fact that eating food is viewed by most as pleasurable whereas a non smoker is unable to understand the craving of a smoker.	these differences are absolutely at the core of why these two situations differ.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	this is a pretty outdated view, and honestly, when people use this argument against the validity of the bible, it makes me wonder how knowledgeable they are on the subject.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	jim gordon is constantly touted as the only good cop the only good cop in a city wide department.
Morality and cheating.	i am arguing that there is no pragmatic reason why you should not cheat.	morality does not have to be pragmatic.
Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	customers understand this and use that to their advantage, making customer service a living hell.
Gender Equality and Chivalry	i do not think you can have gender equality and chivalry coexist.	it is give and take, i think you are a approaching this wrong.
Negotiating fair payment for services/goods.	the service/goods someone is providing exceeds the value of x dollars the buyer is offering.	the government sets a wage floor so you cannot pass on the costs of maintaining your workers on the rest of us through welfare.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	climate change denial is the default position.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	that being said, i very much enjoyed the social aspect of education but i believe that should not be taken into account for this question because i am not attempting to question the benefits of rubbing elbows to either find good comrades for life or nepotism outlets for hard to acquire jobs.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	do you really believe that you can possibly comprehend the reality of what an afterlife would entail ? if you believe the god created the entire universe and every amazing thing in it of which we have the tiniest sliver of knowledge of, and it is still mindblowingly amazing then you have to think that somewhere described as paradise would be even more amazing than that.
The effectiveness of moral methods in helping people.	using moral means/methods to  cleanse/cure  these people is just a joke.	trying to help people is a joke ? your opinion appears disingenuous.
The Definition of Atheism and Belief in Mythological Gods	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	as a remark on consistency, this new definition of skepticism is in direct conflict with your source of  istandard  definitions URL its a false dichotomy that a person cannot both take a position about whether or not their claim is true or not while still being skeptical to it.
Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	i view your whole post as more of an indictment of the failure of laissez faire capitalism.
Smoking and Suicide Prevention	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	so if someone attempts to commit suicide, or has suicidal ideation resulting in self harm, would you label them as  stupid  and shun them ? if you genuinely believe that smoking is intentional self harm, then perhaps it should motivate you to befriend them and help them.
Gender equality in front line warfighting jobs.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	why in the world would you treat those to groups the same.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	the homeowner has no gun, and has to fight knife with knife.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	are there people on there who have not been successful dating by  going out,  of course ! it is a much better way to meet and get to know people for a lot of people.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	if your view is from the result of a position which is in error, then simply pointing out the error should be sufficient enough for you to reconsider your view.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	jews believe in a single god while christians believe in a triune god; these cannot be the same god.
The validity of personal experiences in shaping beliefs.	you could change my view with study is or from experience yourself.	but i have more personal experience: when it has been a few days since i have had sex or masturbated, i find that i have got a little bit of an edge of irritation going on.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	i give you a different story.
Clarifying the distinction between hard and soft atheism.	atheists often dispute that these are separate categories, speaking of hard and soft atheism.	this is an attempt to redefine terms, and is non standard.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	there are very few differences that can be linked to biology when it comes to sex, some you pointed out: gametes and voice pitch.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	i hear the argument a lot that people is profiles do not match what they actually are, as you put it, they are putting their best foot and face forward.
The importance of mandatory writing courses in curriculum.	is there any reason at all to keep these courses in the curriculum, let alone mandatory ?	but as for your points:  i am taking mandatory english classes right now and can say that the curriculum in high school is exactly the same throughout grades  , so it might as well be one year.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	hedonism makes sense.
Sharing personal experience as a universal truth.	projecting your experience to everybody is a logical mistake.	because of this, it is easier for adults to coerce kids into making bad choices.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	the emotional weight different people ascribe to sex differs, some are perfectly capable of having casual sex without forming emotional bonds.
The problem of evil in philosophy.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	if he is  good  but it is not a good that we can understand, why would we call him good at all ?.
Clarifying the distinction between hard and soft atheism.	atheists often dispute that these are separate categories, speaking of hard and soft atheism.	this will be a common theme in my criticisms of your positions.
Gender identity and expression.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	people do not decide to be trans any more than people decide if they are gay or straight.
The ending of a novel.	in the end he learns to love big brother and is finally happy, his last moment is one of complete bliss.	winston smith has not made a choice he is been ground down, broken, and now the party has even violated his mind, changing what he believes on a fundamental level.
Inconsistencies in Wolverine's claws in different movies.	you remember at the end of the wolverine when logan loses his metal claws and regrows the cool as fuck bone claws ?	the arc of the story is pretty easy to establish the future is fucked, wolverine is consciousness goes back in time, he meets up with the people he is supposed to meet up with, does stuff to fix the future, and is successful.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	none of us can address this, not knowing you.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	do you at least appreciate how realistic all the characters are ? do you notice how there really are not good guys or bad guys in this show ? what about the idea that the police have to fight their own bosses just to be able to arrest the criminals ? do not think of them as episodes of a tv show.
Criticism of libertarianism's impact on poverty and prejudice.	libertarianism leads to more poverty, blocks the prevention of racism and other prejudice, and ensures that poor people have little hope of escaping their plight.	another baseless assertion  the prison system needs to be federalized pronto, to crack down on violence.
Marriage as a Reflection of Christ and the Church	i also subscribe to the notion that marriage is meant to be a reflection on christ and the church, that is, a bridegroom christ and a bride the church .	i would like to address this point in particular.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	while this might be true of some religious persons, i am interdenominational.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	just because some do not inherently value belief does not mean belief is inherently without value for everyone.
Correlation between test scores and preparation methods.	however, there is a very strong correlation between act/sat scores and the amount of time/money put into preparing for them.	books and courses meant to help raise your score usually only very slightly raise it.
Gotham City's Crime and Corruption.	the city is plagued by psychotic villains who steal and kill constantly, who seem to manipulate or break their way out of prison with fearful ease.	harvey dent had existing issues with his mental health.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	though bush is policies are often cited as examples of boomer excess, nothing he did was really unique to his generation.
Gender identity and transition options.	i feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the  i feel like i should have been male/female  argument.	but, even if someone did struggle to afford it, why would you not feel sympathy ? would you feel similarly towards someone suffering clinical depression who is unable to afford anti depressants ? is there a universal standard for what it feels like to be a male or female ? can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ? how can anyone  feel  like they should be something other than what they are ? can people  feel  like they should be gay but are not,  feel  like they should be an elephant but are not,  feel  like they should be a phd but are not ? i struggle to understand the notion.
Alternative treatments for gender dysphoria.	fix your dysphoria without going through a potentially disastrous and expensive series of surgeries etc.	a otherwise unknown girl at my school came out as being a lesbian and she became one of the most popular girls, it is ironical.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	take a look at this list URL and notice the ratio of engineers and mathmaticians to artists and cultural leaders.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	the fatigue part is really the key point as to why they cannot play into infinity.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	you can enjoy your music, your art, your education, etc.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	you forget that kings and queens have often been considered  worthy  by god.
Israeli aggression towards neighboring countries.	israel has been continually attacking their neighbours for more land or cause a weakening mayhem upon them; lebanon, syria, iraq soon iran.	huh ? have you ever heard of proof reading ? good  neighbors  do not fire rockets on civilian targets.
Negative effects of participation trophies on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	participation trophies are not there to make every kid feel like a winner.
The importance of narratives in games.	narratives are incredibly important to good games.	i suppose you could claim that games like chess and tafl have a vague  battle  narrative, but most of those do not even have that.
Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	and i am sorry not really if that makes someone butthurt, but its the truth.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	a third error is in thinking that such differences are due to nature and not nurture.
Reading habits of Reddit users.	most reddit users skim comments at best and do not bother to read low enough or read down voted threads.	then again, i am not subbed videos to begin with.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	i am an american who lived in europe admittedly for a short time , and i would agree that americans are more interested in politically correctness/ not offending someone.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	most european scholars until recently were driven by their faith to explore the mysteries of the universe in hope of learning more about god and his creation.
Government's role in marriage.	which made me ask, why the government was even involved in marriage in the first place.	why ? to make the wheels of interactivity turn a little easier.
Affirmative Action Policy	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	the goal should be to change expectations.
Philosophy in Literature	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	plenty of great poems are not philosophical in the slightest.
Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	but, even if someone did struggle to afford it, why would you not feel sympathy ? would you feel similarly towards someone suffering clinical depression who is unable to afford anti depressants ? is there a universal standard for what it feels like to be a male or female ? can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ? how can anyone  feel  like they should be something other than what they are ? can people  feel  like they should be gay but are not,  feel  like they should be an elephant but are not,  feel  like they should be a phd but are not ? i struggle to understand the notion.
Job satisfaction and career aspirations.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	yes but then your dream is not to be artist.
Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	he actually did get renly is support, but he died shortly afterwards.
The depletion of fuel for planes.	planes need fuel, literally tons of it, simply to function.	no fuel, no functioning, no flying.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	so up to  or more of corporate income is just skimmed right off the top and goes to the federal government.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	casting techniques were developed because we wanted to make more complicated forms.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	the biggest benefit of cats is that they require far less maintenance.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	steven weinberg sure, but not all religions encourage blind faith.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	other states massive california has  senate votes, and tiny rhode island has  senate votes and people are represented equally as well each congressman in the house represents about , people.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	in an era of designer genetics, your kid will be competing against other  star  athletes and will probably just be normal.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	sexuality in a heterosexual relationship is not solely a function of procreation.
Negative effects of technological conveniences.	the darker side is that technological conveniences are often less necessary.	fortunately, the chances of ever being in that environment are astronomically low.
Health risks associated with soft drink consumption.	caffeine is an addictive substance, and the high fructose corn syrup that is so common in soft drinks can contribute to many long term health problems including tooth decay, obesity, heart disease, liver failure, and diabetes.	nicotine is.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	that is not the current climate though, not even close.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	once again my view on this profit oriented.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	downvoting and rudeness do not change views.
Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	now, there is a hope that the north will be free from the ironborn raiders, and might be able to feed itself in the coming winter.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	when the corporation earns income, it pays a tax up to  then when it distributes money by way of dividends from e p currently pegged to the capital gains rate that income is taxed  again.
Testing humans and God's omniscience in "Men in Black".	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	if you have seen men in black , you will understand this point.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	there is a reason when you read the lyrics of a song its not done as a paragraph but instead of how you present a poem.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	and there are just as many boomer politicians on the other side wanting a restoration of certain policies and laws.

Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	would you rather not have the fda regulating medicine ? most of the internet trunks out there were government funded; they ought to have a say in how they are used.
Anti-Semitic sentiment during wartime.	hostilities against the jews were more intense because of the war.	he knew full well what invasion would mean.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	you should use them without guilt.
The influence of corporations on government.	due to actions like this, i think that the government of any particular country has to not allow a large business to alter the position of the government in any way, shape, or form.	but a lot of small businesses are corporations too.

Discussion on Fat Shaming.	he was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say  i ca not lose weight.	just bringing it up makes my blood boil so i think i will stop myself here.
Zero tolerance policy in schools	i also believe the laws in place are turning kids into people who ca not solve problems on their own.	that you believe anti bullying policies will have downstream negative effects is speculative: you ca not know with any certainty whether this will be a good or bad thing  years from now.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	however, americans are a diverse group of mostly immigrants, our racist past occurred mostly on our land towards fellow americans rather than in distant colonies, and we are way more into friendliness and apparent niceness than most european countries.

The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	in the end i did not care, i could not care how it would affect anyone which was selfish.
The Definition of Atheism and Belief in Mythological Gods	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	i am skeptical that you will have your view changed, yet i believe that with out testing it by giving it an honest go i ca not know.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	the thing you are missing is that  the standards   are not actually standard  and because there is a  huge  variant in the clientele from bar to bar, there is no reason why there should be any overlap on what a bartender who works at a classy cocktail bar knows versus a bartender from a metal club, aside from one bartender working at both types of bar in their career.
The effects of restricted nudity and internet pornography.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	almost all of these kids will have sex at some point, but few will kill.

Government compensation for descendants of slaves.	i believe detroit would be much more developed if black people received checks from the government.	how would the government go about this when there probably are not many written records of this ? aside from that, the only japanese people who received reparations were the ones who were actually sent to internment camps.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	you are not floating around being aware of your situation.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	once a child is able to think critically, then it is absolutely reasonable to hold off on the spanking and give a rational explanation of why certain actions are not an option.
Philosophy in Literature	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	well, just as, say, novels can be philosophical by which i guess i mean address issues relevant to philosophy , poems can be philosophical too, but there is no reason to think that wanting  something philosophical  is the reason that most people read and appreciate poetry.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	europeans are just as attracted to nudity as americans it shows in their advertising, just as it does in ours.

Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	by i will say that as a society we have some intensely fucked up perspectives on both genders.

Identity and the effects of drugs/alcohol on perception.	i have observed that while high/drunk users exhibit and/or report that their emotions, perceptions, thought processes, behavior, and memory are altered, if only temporarily.	in fact, by trying to get your opinion changed, you also are changing your perception, thought process and memory.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	so i will add them as replies here, segregating them into each point.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	a lot of people love to complain about how a few rich and powerful people run the country karl rove, the nra, the koch brothers, etc if you are a liberal; unions, george soros, etc, if you are conservative , but then go and vote for people from political families in primaries.
Philosophy vs Science.	there is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist ca not.	that is like saying  there is nothing a geologist can do that a structural engineer ca not.
Racism and Stereotyping.	if you cross the street based purely on race that would be racist.	if you were scared of a black man in a suit and tie mugging you, you have issues.
Job dissatisfaction and management issues.	my managers overlook how much i help the company and how loyal i am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, i  talk back  too much.	there are positions where you do actual work, and then there are positions where you manage workers and have to play politics.
Faith and the nature of God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	perhaps it will be so complex that we wo not see it for thousands of years, but unless god is just sitting on his ass for eternity, he will be doing something, and that something is theoretically detectable.
Importance of Proper Communication in Job Interviews	i am pretty sure i could not have even gotten an interview if i spoke like lil  montrell up the street haha.	speaking as a hiring manager, op is completely correct.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	live to your beliefs and values.

Drug use and altering one's state of mind.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	i need to alter my mind to grow and mature, we should not all be stuck with the mind of a  year old.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	sure the government helped, but they were not responsible.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	the book is a fascinating and horrifying experience.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	so, if you want to profit from the value the us dollar carries you are going to have to comply with the terms you and i have agreed upon.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	minorities demanding respect and equal treatment are not just concerned with their feelings, but their ability to get a job and receive fair wages as well as not being targeted by the police.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	this is because the burden of proof is on the person making a claim.

Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	in fact it is often unwanted attention depending on your level of attractiveness.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	as a remark on consistency, this new definition of skepticism is in direct conflict with your source of  istandard  definitions URL its a false dichotomy that a person cannot both take a position about whether or not their claim is true or not while still being skeptical to it.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	especially to those of your faith although, that being said, speaking to those that do not share your faith is often very enlightening too.
Psychopathy as a mental illness.	rodger left a lucid, coherent explanation of his crimes.	what kind of evidence is required ? can a person be mentally ill even though there is no diagnosis ? his actions seems fairly consistent with the actions of a psychopath URL do you consider psychopathy to be a mental illness ? i do.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	a mixture of science and art.
Government's role in contract enforcement.	so why would the government want to ease your financial life when you fall deeply in love with someone else ?	because contract enforcements are a business of the government.
The limitations of deriving meaning from criminal behavior.	that being said, to try to derive anything exceptionally deep or meaningful about society from any of these things i do not think is particularly useful.	or, in the world we live in where political inertia is ever present, perhaps using the motivation and interest from the crime is exactly the right moment to help move along legislation that is sorely needed.
Government's role in marriage.	which made me ask, why the government was even involved in marriage in the first place.	the real question would be, why is religion trying to get control of marriage ?.
Russian aggression towards Ukraine.	the government of the united states and ukraine have both denounced russia is actions as against  international law .	do not think of it necessarily as a moral thing.

Difficulty of Combos and Lack of Advanced Techniques in a Game.	combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there is no l cancelling, wavedashing or other related high level techniques that can be used.	it is a glitch.
Debate on the importance of animal species conservation.	i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	how do you think species will die out ? it is not some harmless process.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	you mention loss of land, loss of life, and modern day native populations as evidence of genocide, when in fact they are all the exact opposite of that.
Taxation and Wealth Redistribution for Large Corporations.	firstly, higher tax rates for large corporations would redistribute wealth in society, without greatly affecting the rich individuals in question.	once you could secure a region and install a leader, your next step would be infrastructure.
Debate on the effectiveness of killing to solve problems.	when we can just rid the world of these things by killing them.	the point is that these are possible areas where rehabilitation can find success.

Fantasy character interactions and offspring.	if two of the characters get married, i want to see the ridiculous offspring of my roommate and jennifer lawrence for example.	while i am not as upset about this as others are, i do think it is a detriment to the game from a gameplay perspective.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	these are all real examples from my time dating women who seemed normal at first when i met them in real life, their best foot was forward, their real life profile got presented over the course of the first few dates instead of a quick read and a few chat messages exchanged to accelerate things.
Criticism of rural group's barbaric behavior.	by comparison, her whole group proceeded to fight and scream at each other throughout the whole night, completely fail at mounting an effective defense or escape, and ended up killing each other/getting eaten until she was the only one left.	is there any evidence to suggest that these rural folk had to deal with the exact same situations as the main characters ? maybe by location of where they were and what they do for sport gave them a far easier and less stressful situation to deal with.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	all else is subjective and unpersuasive.
Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	a countries independence is important.

The effectiveness of vaccinations.	the evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.	that does not mean professional race car drivers are all delusional.
Smoking and its justifications.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	apart from that i see no real problem.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	for example, a child might hide his parent is checkbook.
Relationship between religion and science.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.	also odd that literacy is a direct cause of people wanting to read the bible, torah, and qu ran.
Discipline of children and spanking as a form of punishment.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	another great reasons why spanking is better than other forms of punishment is that spanking is fast.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	jim gordon is not the only decent cop in gcpd.
Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	they feel that the transgendered movement belittles and muddles what is a serious political issue today.
Discipline and Spanking in Children's Behavior.	kids these days are unruly and need to be taught discipline !	i would posit that some of the worst behaved children i have met are some of the most spanked.
Reading habits of Reddit users.	most reddit users skim comments at best and do not bother to read low enough or read down voted threads.	first off, reddit is not a homogenous community with a common ideology.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	that same day, one such day of rejoicing for the poles, the germans took  poles from a labour camp near gdynia to a prison yard in the town of wejherowo.
Philosophy vs Science.	there is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist ca not.	are completely ideological.
Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	my philosophy in life is just to be excellent to each other.
Job dissatisfaction and management issues.	my managers overlook how much i help the company and how loyal i am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, i  talk back  too much.	why would anybody want to move you out of a position in which you are providing a real benefit ? there is no ethical implication here.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	i carry my gun everywhere, and if i decide to go to chipotle i am not going to leave my gun at home and i am going to ignore their polite request, and no one will know.
Income inequality and its effects on society.	in the countries which have the least income inequality the scandinavian countries and japan crime and poverty are reduced, but birth rates are unusually low and depression is high.	the birth rate statistic is a rather irrelevant one regarding desirability.
Comparison of chopsticks and forks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	the fork is a blunt instrument which is not useful in many situations that chopsticks are far better suited for.
Fantasy character interactions and offspring.	if two of the characters get married, i want to see the ridiculous offspring of my roommate and jennifer lawrence for example.	would not it be a good idea to reinforce that being gay is okay and normal so that it is easier for children when that time of their life does come ?.
Health risks associated with soft drink consumption.	caffeine is an addictive substance, and the high fructose corn syrup that is so common in soft drinks can contribute to many long term health problems including tooth decay, obesity, heart disease, liver failure, and diabetes.	i have also heard that soft drinks contain another dangerous chemical: dihydrogen monoxide dhmo ! dhmo may cause severe burns, is fatal if inhaled, accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals, and has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.

Atheism as Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	in other words absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	none of the policies reagan introduced can therefore possibly be blamed on the baby boomer generation.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	it makes sense to believe that your conscious experience right now will be recycled at death and transformed into something else, just like everything else in this universe.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	reduce the amount of effort required , at the cost of individuality, health, or the ability to function in a less pampering environment.

Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	having to struggle with one of the hardest addictions in life only heroin has a bigger addiction potential afaik and that is marginally just because you wanted to be cool during the period of your life that you will care the least about once you grow up is just not a good choice.
Origins and significance of "Deutschlandlied"	deutschlandlied is a song of unity, peace, and brotherhood from the very first stanza.	likewise, the  von der maas bis an die memel  line references germans living in poland during the th century, who were expelled from poland in  for obvious reasons.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	they can tell the difference between a threat and a friend, and can be trained to attack an intruder or alert the owner if a stranger is around.
Participation trophies and their impact on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	i think there is age where it stops.
The validity of personal experiences in shaping beliefs.	you could change my view with study is or from experience yourself.	i am better able to focus on goals and tasks that do not have anything to do with sexy times.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	having high standards is fine, provided you are realistic about them.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	and  that  is a different and much harder problem entirely.
Human adaptability and survival.	humans will simply adapt and move on, we are an incredibly resourceful species and have collectively survived or overcome every single challenge posed to us.	i agree that we should also invest in science and technology for future solutions, but simply putting it off is foolish procrastination.
Outrage culture and privilege.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	while you are not personally affected, the victims of stereotype are.
Hitler's intentions and Britain's war guarantee towards Poland.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	appeasement failed, because hitler went back on agreements he made, and kept taking.

Human fetus and the use of the word "potential".	human fetus is a stage in the life of a human being.	are sperm humans ? even a fertilized egg may not be human molar pregnancies.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	which shoots a hole in your base premise that the internet is a private industry that came from private research and private investment.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	the bartenders  absolutely  knew that a martini with either gin or vodka has vermouth as an ingredient, but a lot of people in the bar apparently did not like vermouth but were ignorant that it was part of a vodka martini, to the point that the manager told his bar staff to ask for every martini.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	the only way to accomplish that is to work jobs that provide a lot of that value, which means a providing a very valuable service that lots of people are willing to pay for, or b becoming a valuable and  non replaceable  asset to such a provider and getting a piece of the action.
Morality and cheating.	i am arguing that there is no pragmatic reason why you should not cheat.	we do not, and because we do not, you are gambling with your so is feelings.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	people are not going to voluntarily give money away in order to support society.
Difficulty of Combos and Lack of Advanced Techniques in a Game.	combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there is no l cancelling, wavedashing or other related high level techniques that can be used.	it destroys game balance, though it destroys it in a way that allows competitive play.
Opinions on Acting Skill and Roleplaying.	i find bad acting very cringey, and i do not act well so trying out roleplaying/watching other people act badly does not appeal to me.	on a more unrelated level.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	i see people rewarded for never once considering the ramifications of their actions or words simply because they convey confidence.
Baker refusing to make cake for polygamous marriage.	what if a baker refused to make a cake for a polygamous marriage ?	would the law force them to make a cake in that case ? potentially based on protections against religious discrimination.
Genetics and Sexual Orientation	so far there is no evidence that i know of that proves that there is a gene or several genes for that matter that determine your sexual orientation.	what could possibly be the cause ? natural nurture: hormones a fetus is exposed to in the womb.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	also, including the usa into that group is rather crazy considering how fervently neutral the us tried to be.
Complexity of Evolution vs Creationism.	complex topics like evolution and celestial mechanics would require thousands of years of discovery to even begin to comprehend.	not on every level, just evolution and deep time.
The reality of military service.	so, with that wrapped up, i figure i can spice up my life a little. some adventure, no ?	what exactly do you want to do ? fight ? work in a support role ? there are a lot of other jobs that have some degree of excitement and solidarity that do not require giving up control over your life, or having to kill people.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	certain actions have natural consequences.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	that is definitely not always the case and is an attitude that generally libertarians are against.

Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	how much more do you think it can cost to transport all of your things your car, your clothing, your picture frames, your books, etc.
Cohl's peace after killing Childress and his role in religion.	however, after cohl and hart kill childress cohl seems truly at peace, even though he has not gotten the full truth or come anywhere near getting justice for the victims.	i think cohl is resolution was, in my view, a mixed bag.

Proof of God's existence through logic.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	saying that there is such teapot is completely irrational.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	i am not an economist or a psychologist, but based on my experiences in the financial industry, the root of the incentive to make lots of cash stems from wanting financial security.
The meaning of "God" in the context of religion.	change my view that god should represent the shared human concept of existence for people who claim to be religious, as anything less thought out than that basically implies that the word  god  has no more meaning within the framework of our reality.	words only have value if there is a shared definition, and thus we need a strong rational behind changing a words term.
Withdrawal from Cannabis Classification on Website	while withdrawal from cannabis has absolutely no drawbacks.	do not believe me ? here is a link for you.

Gender equality in front line warfighting jobs.	i think the modern idea that everyone is the same just does not hold up.	maybe you should have a look at the idea of equal opportunity vs.
Gender Quality in Two Nations.	let is say nation a has men who have more superior qualities mentioned above than nation b, but fewer women of high quality.	thus, the optimal match would be men from nation a and women from nation b, in order to produce the best offspring.

Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	in addition it would be bad for business if companies could pay to alter the search results.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	many if not most rape victims who get pregnant from the rape get an abortion.
The effects of restricted nudity and internet pornography.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	simulated violence, people freak out when you air actual bodies, you cant do the same with nudity, its either all or nothing.
Testing humans and God's omniscience in "Men in Black".	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	god does not know just exactly how your life will turn out in one direction, but in all of them.

Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	so are high standards bad ? nah, not always, but when coupled with an entitlement complex and a lack of desire for self improvement, they can be a sign of someone who has an unrealistic view about themselves and what they deserve out of life.

Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	is it possible that at that bar, a lot of people order manhattans without bitters ? i was asked if i wanted vermouth in a vodka martini at the classier bar once, because i asked the bartender about this a lot of people ask them to hold the vermouth there, or get mad when they add it without telling them.

The challenges of relationships and breakups.	not to mention becoming emotionally compromised if a break up were to occur.	in the end, nothing works out.

Smoking and its rationality.	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	plus, you have addiction which defies rational thought.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	you might argue that the military has been misapplied in recent years, but you have to admit that there is also legitimate use of the military such as hunting down al qaeda and coast guard rescue divers.
Awareness of Jesus and religious persecution during the Holocaust.	obviously every single adult in a western country has heard of jesus already, and has had the opportunity to convert.	these poor souls have not accepted jesus, they are good people, maybe if they read up about us, they will join us  it was rude, but their intentions were pure.

Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	if you rape or pillage, stannis will kill you, unlike joffrey who, through his grandfather, ordered the raping and pillaging.
The motivation behind suicide.	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	it is certainly not the only motivation people have for killing themselves.
The limitations of deriving meaning from criminal behavior.	that being said, to try to derive anything exceptionally deep or meaningful about society from any of these things i do not think is particularly useful.	people seemed to have had no problem accepting that when ted bundy or jeffrey dahmer, or peter sutcliffe did his thing.
Chopstick etiquette and soup slurping.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	you mean like the cultures that use them ? i have a nice polymer diswasher safe pair at home that i use all the time.

Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	it is not that libertarians are cold, uncaring people, but rather that they want more control over where their money goes and feel the federal government especially is coercive and does not manage money well i mean, look at the amount of debt the country is in.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	now the uk is disarmed, yet violent crime is so common that the police carry submachine guns.

Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	because the word is associated with outdated racist views and they the people you are referring to do not want to be referred to in that way.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	they are leaving us in the lurch with mountains of debt and a broken economy all because they could not bother to admit that the social and economic policies developed  years ago  do not work  in this day and age.
The positive impact of religion on society.	i feel like the amount of charity people give to the world in the name of their faith more than balances these rare incidents.	it is a specific example of the tangible results of dogmatic beliefs.
Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	this is incorrect.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	let me compare and contrast two bars i have been to/frequented in the past.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	it is not the fault of the people who market products that people do not give a shit about there health.
Criminal disenfranchisement and empathy-based morality in voting rights.	if we can agree that laws are based on commonly accepted standards of morality and that morality is based on empathy, then people who have proven their lack of empathy through their own criminality should  almost by definition  not be given the right to vote.	so should people have to prove they are capable of empathy before being allowed to vote ? why only focus on the people we catch ?.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	this is background information, telling the history of the church is beliefs.

Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	a lot of our modern history has included marginalization and outright genocide, but we are still alive, we are still here, and we can still celebrate our heritage.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	i find that to be unreasonable.
Society's tendency towards outrage culture.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	and yet you do realize that there would be people who would be offended by that, right ? and we live in a society where an honest statement of offense is often met by a feigned counter reaction that is itself outraged.
Ethical dilemma of sacrificing one life to save many.	a father is first priority in that situation, is the well being of his daughter.	but even if it did, what about the other fireflies ? if you are saying that doing something for the well being of your family makes it right then the fireflies are even more in the right than joel.

Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	people are not going to voluntarily give money away in order to support society.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	in all the cases, we do question the accuser, and the accused often gets off scott free due to lack of evidence.

Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	which will require change, but what economy is static anyway ? heck, there are concepts in economics that laud such activity in the first place ! but hey, maybe you should follow your own advice, about not insulting people ? you do realize it is insulting to ascribe to others such a negative motivation, as well as some of your other descriptions.

Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	the child does not experience this natural consequence of his action, so it is up to his parent to provide some sort of punishment to link the child is actions with a negative consequence in his mind.
Effects of Spanking on Children's Thinking and Behavior	spanking does not encourage critical thinking: child a:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy will hit me  child b:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy explained x will happen.	it is about fear and authority, and subordination.

Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	ethically speaking, you should probably care more about sentient life than non sentient life, and conscious life more than non conscious life.
The role of faith in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	if god has a tangible effect on the world or anyone is lives, there will be something like this.
Gender stereotypes in media portrayal of romantic relationships.	women are often portrayed in the media as being very concerned about romantic love and men as commitment phobes more interested in sex.	romantic love is a secondary concern to them.
Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	it does not feel right, it should be a man is face, but yet you look in the mirror and there is no mistaking it.
Smoking and Suicide Prevention	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	the demonization of smokers, especially in the us, has worked to some extent in reducing smoking but it has also hurt plenty of smokers.
Men's primary concern: Romantic Love.	men, however  do  have romantic love as their primary concern.	i do not think this is accurate.
Password Security and Formula Usage.	ideally, passwords should not be reused, and a formula should be used to generate unique passwords for each account you have.	if the attacker had as few as  two  generated passwords, it is likely he could crack the generation method entirely, and have all your passwords then.
Prescription Refill Reminder	what if you did not realize you were out of refills ?	this does not seem like a good excuse, they are on a pretty set schedule and they are the only one taking it.
Discipline and Spanking in Children's Behavior.	kids these days are unruly and need to be taught discipline !	however, do you know that any type of discipline would work for these kids, or that it is therefore obvious that spanking would not work for other kids.
The limitations of deriving meaning from criminal behavior.	that being said, to try to derive anything exceptionally deep or meaningful about society from any of these things i do not think is particularly useful.	the extreme cases are where the juicy new bits of knowledge reside.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	he then suffered an unfortunate and improbable defeat, but he rallied plenty of people regardless.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	i am not sure where you are getting that they will be mentally inferior, this seems to be a bit of an unsupported argument.
Stannis as a ruler	i expect the realm under stannis would most likely fall apart in a few years.	he would then be renly is heir renly could make the best of the situation by backing stannis, and then all of that good stuff happens.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	bullying is wrong.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	read the following passage.
Comparing effects of cannabis and alcohol use.	cannabis also mellows you out, makes you more relaxed and heightens the imagination and improves creativity.	i have definitely seen people in my high school drop out and become drug dealers because they became so dependent on weed that they made it their first priority.
Gender imbalance in the technology industry.	i just do not believe that forcing an uninterested party into an industry is the answer to a non existent problem.	again, what leads you to that conclusion ? who is forcing anyone into industries they do not want to be in ? where is this happening ? working to shift our cultural biases away from gender stereotypes related to occupation is hardly that.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	source married the woman i found on a dating website.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	you not paying the taxes you agreed to pay is theft.
Negotiating car purchase with cash upfront.	cash up front gives me leverage to negotiate a better price on the purchase.	i ca not recall all the details of a k and i do not know all of your finances or the car finances, so i am making big assumptions here.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	unlike other sports that allow regular substitutions or, in the case of mlb, there is minimal physical activity.
Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	a stock market crash in new york will not just make new york destitute, but every place that does business in or with new york, which is most of the world and the entirety of the us.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	grinkle is a pelleous glorp.
Problems with income taxes.	i also want to clarify that i am not against all taxes, but i find income taxes particularly problematic.	this is why it works.
Human fetus and the use of the word "potential".	human fetus is a stage in the life of a human being.	we do not call them butterflies until they come out of the cocoon.
Government compensation for descendants of slaves.	i believe detroit would be much more developed if black people received checks from the government.	also, there have already been programs like affirmative action which have been put in place to try to solve the problems that were caused by racism and slavery.
The problem of evil in philosophy.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	god is the only one with a universal perspective, so he may have an excellent reason for all of this that we just do not comprehend.
Comparison of chopsticks and forks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	also, bamboo is a sustainable resource and is perfectly suited for the construction of chopsticks.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	you can have as much wealth as you want or wish, to use now throughout many different places world wide, which is something that most other currencies do not allow you to do.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	i would argue this is not necessarily the fault of the bar, which is serving a clientele that does not request these often, but rather the assumption that every bar be able to produce these drinks regardless of type.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	but okay, sure, you will have a different ecosystem for awhile, at least in the short term.
Controversy surrounding the use of the word "redskin"	first off when has anyone every heard the word redskin outside of talking about the professional football team ?	so they are drunk and thieving.
Teenage driving safety and texting while driving.	teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	you are making a lot of generalizations.
Awareness of Jesus and religious persecution during the Holocaust.	obviously every single adult in a western country has heard of jesus already, and has had the opportunity to convert.	if you are a drunk or you see that your life is not as fulfilling as you wish, some people will turn to religion, it is not a bad thing.
Israeli aggression towards neighboring countries.	israel has been continually attacking their neighbours for more land or cause a weakening mayhem upon them; lebanon, syria, iraq soon iran.	evidence ? i think you should concentrate on forming a legible sentence st.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	like many people who i have met who have similar views i do not find any fault in teachers, many teachers even to this day i find are remarkable to the point that i still get teary eyed thinking about them.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	two mothers could not have nearly that kind of impact on me.
Individuality and Equal Opportunity in Society	i do not want the same as others, i want a chance to fulfill my own dreams and objectives.	i find that to be unreasonable.
The difficulty of winning the war against terrorism.	we could literally blow up every remaining terrorist, and we still would have lost the war.	from seeing an force that is residing in his home country.
The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it is in the process of changing now.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	my post could get incredibly long because this is a very large topic.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	and pressure ? yeah, parents pressure children to do lots of things.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	i felt a bit cornered in the way he approached me and it made me uncomfortable.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	i am going to have to ask for a citation here.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	i do not believe that attacking people for statements that are not pc is particularly useful, but i think for the aforementioned reasons being pc is more important to americans for more real world outcomes than merely being offended.
Disagreeing with Webster's Dictionary and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.	disagreeing with webster is dictionary and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.	if your view is from the result of a position which is in error, then simply pointing out the error should be sufficient enough for you to reconsider your view.
Freedom of speech and the First Amendment.	if someone could change my view that would be great, because then the world, while still being that little bit more annoying would at least make sense.	i wish i could make people understand that the fact that society frowns on some words is not an attack against  you , or somehow bounding you up in chains.
Nudity in Men's Locker Rooms.	which i believe directly leads to people not feeling comfortable in their own naked bodies.	what in porn makes a girl not like her hair ? how does porn make girls with straight hair curl it, and girls with curly hair straighten it ? there are not too many rural folks that uptight about all these  issues  where i live.
Comparison of chopsticks and forks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	you will note that chopsticks perform admirably in all these situations.
The reality of military service.	so, with that wrapped up, i figure i can spice up my life a little. some adventure, no ?	if they think you can fly fighter jets, great.
Pets: Dogs vs. Cats	a dog can be a security animal.	cats are generally self sufficient, but unfortunately this leads people to assume that they do not need training, they do.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	if god did exist, he would be natural by definition.
The cost of being a superpower.	if we were no longer a superpower, we would not have to spend billions of dollars being be the policeman for other countries and trying and often failing to spread democracy elsewhere.	our military engagements around the world are specifically to further our agenda.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	good, those tax incentives are there for you.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	in general people who thoroughly study the bible believers and nonbelievers alike understand that it never speaks of the age if the earth at any point.
Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	they are rewarded for being obnoxious because managers and workers by extension are told by corporate to leave their human dignity at the door and do as they say.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	after death you either:  do not exist.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	you ca not divorce religious ideas from the equation.
Testing humans and reliance on simulation.	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	as one of those people who can do wrong, i think it is better to exist and have the chance to do right than to not exist and have the safety of doing neither.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	that is not the test.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	absolutely.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	skepticism is rejection of a claim until the evidence can be accessed.
Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	then educate people and have them make their own decisions based on the facts.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	the world has grown but the two are still intrinsically linked.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	each one of those presidents has made horrible decisions in office but the policy decisions that led to the  collapse were made by the policy makers.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	but i think many people in our society need more courage and resilience to achieve their potential, and to merely function in most cases.
The ethics of giving to the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	i get opportunities you never will, simply because those opportunities require the trust of people you think you are smart enough to fool but you are not.
Intelligence and Curiosity in Children and Adults.	but  average  kids outsmart me all the time.	it does not require any specific knowledge and the person did not practice such types of logic puzzles in any way.
Libertarianism and Social Liberalism	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	they believe in social and financial freedom be who you want to be and support yourself; do not force others to pay for your xyz.
Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	the point of this discussion is that drug use is not the same kind of criminal behavior as all the other crimes you are placing it alongside.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	it can, but it does not have too.
Paternity leave and feminism in the labor market.	paternity leave increase in the cost of labor market rigidity unemployment.	this ignores the equalizing effect of making women more desirable as workers.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	those who have certain experiences while on drugs would still want to have them sober, and would still enjoy them sober.
Password Security and Formula Usage.	ideally, passwords should not be reused, and a formula should be used to generate unique passwords for each account you have.	but if you use such a formula, then all an attacker needs is to crack the formula and he has cracked all your passwords.
Economic modeling and impact of a policy.	as such i feel all debate around the topic right now is pretty meaningless.	so the economists will need to try and determine that based on how businesses and individuals responded to past financial incentives.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	the preexisting cultural and religious rift between the north and south was turned into a gaping chasm; any rule of the iron throne in the north would now be viewed as hostile foreign occupation.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	you can see that simple fact proved by an important time period.
Federal government's power and control over minimum wage.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	it is not quite that simple when it comes to human interaction.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	i think this falls under a distinctly different value set than most of the pc language policing as it is more concerned with a unified front than it is the respect for individual feelings.
Comparison of regular birth control pills and Plan B.	why should regular daily pill birth control be any different ?	the worst case scenarios are blood clots, primarily from estrogens, but some synthetic progestogens increase risk for blood clot.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	that does not mean that everyone knows them.
Alternative treatments for gender dysphoria.	fix your dysphoria without going through a potentially disastrous and expensive series of surgeries etc.	yeah this is a good reason, but i think the government will start paying for those operations, since they are the results of factors out of the peoples control.
Comparison of chopsticks and forks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	it cannot pick up extremely small things, such as fish bones.
Animal Extinction and Preservation	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	have fun if all the insect pollinators of food crops disappear.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	atheism is lacking belief in a god, but not claiming that no god exists.
The positive impact of religion on society.	i feel like the amount of charity people give to the world in the name of their faith more than balances these rare incidents.	without religion, evil people would not stop being evil.
Trade with countries lacking freedom, justice, and equality.	why should developed countries trade with countries which have a lack of freedom, justice, and equality ?	china has a lack of equality.
Animal Extinction and Preservation	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	nature has killed far more animals than we ever will, and yet the earth has survived.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	however, i do not think your motivation to follow them should be to avoid getting caught.
Federal government's power to address economic and social issues.	states that adopted policies that led to economic depression or social injustice would likely change their policies because people would move out.	why do we give them that power ? the federal government of the us is an attempt to coordinate the efforts and interests of over  million people, and so has the power of over  million people.
Smoking and its rationality.	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	the question them becomes a matter how how that person believes the risk to balance out between the negative and positive.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	also, a shootout does provide a  definitive conclusion , just not in the manner that you would like.
Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	he tries to be objectively just, and is stubborn in the pursuit of it.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	the practically is that they are not weapons like knives and forks, and they were invented before the spoon:  t is commonly known that the chinese invented chopsticks or kuaizi in chinese as a set of instruments to be used when eating but the reason behind that is not commonly known.
Tipping and servers' wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	i can imagine it is even more frustrating to other service industry workers who make less than these servers do.
The dangers of smoking and developing addiction.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	r/leaves can give you an insight of quitters having a very hard time quitting cannabis.
The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	things will get better.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	if people need a certain belief religious or otherwise to make their life livable and worth it, then what qualifies critics to tell them otherwise ? people believe things for many reasons, and  nobody  believes everything in their life solely for reasons that are proven by hard science.
Beauty pageants and child safety.	from what i have seen, beauty pageants take on a  cutesy  vibe, not a sexual one.	you ca not enforce a law on something as subjective as someone is intentions.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	i would also like to hear views from people have have paid for private education and home schooling.
Philosophy vs. Science	there is nothing a philosopher can do that a scientist ca not.	handling ambiguity, which happens in the real world, is better handled by those who have not learned to rely on quantitative data.
Negative effects of corporal punishment.	spanking has also been linked to drug abuse, criminal behavior, and mental/emotional issues.	you could replace  spanking  with any form of discipline here and make the exact same statement you are making.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	however the position he has attempted to establish is replacing the concept of the null hypothesis with indecision.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	he barely survived one siege, but he won.
Pizza sizes and confusion.	my point is that when places like dominos and pizza hut sell you s, m, l pies, you have no way to know what you are getting.	when you order pizza through their website they tell you the size of their pizzas.
Tattoos and their significance.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	i am kind of confused about your actual view given your prompt and your responses.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	do you have a source for this or is it just conjecture ? i think if president hillary clinton went on a diplomatic trip to europe, bill would probably tag along and have influence that he really ought not have as a past president.
Parenting strategies.	the actual difficulty just comes from figuring out what kind of strategy you want to utilize to raise your kid.	no way is this true.
Federal government's control over constitution.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	depending on how far you move, there is a cost associated with moving your things.
Same-sex marriages in a life simulation game.	there is a work around that allows same sex marriages, which is to make a male character a female or vise versa.	i do not want to marry a girl who looks like a boy, i want to marry a boy.
Overpaid athletes in professional sports.	for instance, nba players make tens of millions of dollars a year for what ?	their pay is representative of their value to the league and in doing so further the amount of money the league and it is business partners earn.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	europe has a much healthier cellular market.
Helping the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	and aside from that, you can adapt your worldview to realize that there are other people besides yourself, and their happiness is worth as much if not more than yours.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	it is a catch .
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	self deception necessarily involves a mental act of self destruction, a  disintegration  of one is integrity.
Opinions on Donald Trump's wife, Melania.	but more importantly she does not appear like gold digger, she feels she earned everything with work.	she improves donald is image, and also she seems very committed to him for some reason.
The distinction between hard and soft sciences.	there really is no  soft science  or  hard science , only good science, bad science and pseudo science.	it might be much more useful to have a well educated guess about  x  than to know precise details about  y.
Evidence of God's existence through various means.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.
Uncertainty about future career path.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	just because you, personally, do not like chemistry does not mean that it should just be done away with as a required class.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	i think a lot of more casual people who show up to vote once every  years and do not stay informed, which is most of the electorate, is very likely to do this.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	the goal has to be to educate and understand rather than demand some definitive redress.
The importance of science in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	it is a function of civilization and needed for a civilization to thrive.
Federal government's power and control over minimum wage.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	and do not even suggest city and county governments.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	do you have any sources for this ? i hear  iselfish  levied against libertarians often, but in my experience, that is very far from the truth.
Theodicy and the problem of evil.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	disclaimer: i am agnostic, i am kind of playing devils advocate here.
Philosophy in Literature	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	poetry is art.
The impact of marriage equality on queer culture.	rather i want to be convinced that in having marriage equality mankind would not be losing the rich and unique culture that is queer culture.	that is just a tad hyperbolic, do not you think ? even if part of the culture is lost, how is that  dangerous  ? and assuming that you are right regarding assimilation, do you think that regardless of the fact that many gays and lesbians freely want to give up this culture, they should:   be forced to retain it, against their will ? be denied equality for the sake of retaining their own culture ? did giving women equal rights to men not also get rid of a  unique  culture, where women were subjugated and had no voting rights ? should we have kept a misogynist culture like that of mad men, because it is unique ? i am sure they also had their own  unique jargons, histories, familial structures, and belief systems.
The positive impact of religion on society.	i feel like the amount of charity people give to the world in the name of their faith more than balances these rare incidents.	this too is irrelevant, because there is not a  single  tangible, real life benefit that religion and dogmatic beliefs provide that cannot be achieved through purely secular means.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	you wo not just lose animal species.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	i am not an expert.
The effectiveness of vaccinations.	the evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.	that is what happens when you judge rationality on a  there is only one truth  perspective.
The path to finding God through trust/faith versus enlightenment.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	we need reasonable evidence for all claims.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	likewise, being sober can provide a context for certain experiences that using drugs would be inappropriate for.
The dangers of smoking and developing addiction.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	then there is also the issue with smoking itself, you are inhaling a burned plant, do not think it is so different to cigarrettes, it is nearly the same minus the nicotine.
Cultural disintegration in a globalized world.	with the world becoming more and more of a melting pot, cultures seem to be disintegrating.	cultures also change from external forces of technology, philosophy, entertainment etc.
Criticism of the free market and Luxottica's business practices.	that is not how the free market should work.	in fact, i  do  have a choice.
Controversy surrounding the use of the word "redskin"	first off when has anyone every heard the word redskin outside of talking about the professional football team ?	it is an interesting read.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	this would be to assume that the goal of a company is to maximize employment.
The influence of corporations on government.	due to actions like this, i think that the government of any particular country has to not allow a large business to alter the position of the government in any way, shape, or form.	why are they ok and corporations not ?.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	or travelling to another country.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	do you have to just stand by the door and look like you are gonna punch the person if they go through ? or do you have to kind of wedge yourself in there ? no witnesses besides the two parties in question, and some neighbors who heard shouting, btw.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	you mean like the cultures that use them ? i have a nice polymer diswasher safe pair at home that i use all the time.
The reality of military service.	so, with that wrapped up, i figure i can spice up my life a little. some adventure, no ?	it is great place to learn some skills and make some money for college, but please do not join because you think it will be fun and exciting.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	the want for security has been inherent to the human condition since we have bartered shoes for rice.

Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	this alternative is much worse.
Animal exploitation and consent argument.	the only way the consent argument can be strong is if you are arguing from the standpoint we should not exploit animals period.	the same cannot be said for fucking a cow, that has nothing to do with the cow is health and is completely unnecessary so your argument does not really apply there.

Difficulty of Combos and Lack of Advanced Techniques in a Game.	combos are hard/impossible to link, the physics are too slow and there is no l cancelling, wavedashing or other related high level techniques that can be used.	the fact is that super smash brothers is a  very  good franchise, and a diversity of people enjoy it for different purposes.

Freedom of speech and the use of the word "oriental"	now i was just wondering why we ca not say the word oriental.	same thing happened with  negro , which is why it is generally a poor idea to call blacks negros in the us at least.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	but how do you know you would not be better, similar, or about anybody else ? you will rarely find an adopted child, even a baby, being breastfed by their adopted parents.

The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	there is also an element of hypocrisy here: if the church got rid of every gay member.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	what would an agnostic do ? they have been presented evidence, at that moment they would need to either decide if that evidence is sufficient to sway their belief or concoct some scheme so that they can be non committal in the face of evidence.
The role of faith in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	because in order to accept the fact that faith is necessary, faith must be put into the text to begin with.

Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	some salt water species are only around in the summer.
Fantasy character interactions and offspring.	if two of the characters get married, i want to see the ridiculous offspring of my roommate and jennifer lawrence for example.	since their target audience is, in my opinion, children,  i ca not imagine the majority of them have decided whether they are gay or straight.
Customer behavior and rewards.	the customers who get the most are not the most loyal or the kindest, but the most ignorant and the most obnoxious.	how is that them being stupid ? given a system used to evaluate something, the people who come out on top are always those who understand the system and know how to game it, be it grades, sat scores, promotions, etc.

Reading habits of Reddit users.	most reddit users skim comments at best and do not bother to read low enough or read down voted threads.	further, you are damning everyone who did not click into the comments to begin with for something they could not have been aware of.
The cost of being a superpower.	if we were no longer a superpower, we would not have to spend billions of dollars being be the policeman for other countries and trying and often failing to spread democracy elsewhere.	if we do not try to stabilize these countries or otherwise turn them on our side , it will come back to bite us in the future.
Trade with countries lacking freedom, justice, and equality.	why should developed countries trade with countries which have a lack of freedom, justice, and equality ?	sorry, what exactly is your view ? you talk about how countries that violate human rights have criminal policies, and as such, we should not trade with them, out of protest.
Cohl's peace after killing Childress and his role in religion.	however, after cohl and hart kill childress cohl seems truly at peace, even though he has not gotten the full truth or come anywhere near getting justice for the victims.	he felt that wave of relief, but it seemed to me that he despaired at losing it when he came back to the world of the living.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	it was not just robb; thousands of common soldiers and multiple tullys, manderlys, mormons, flints, blackwoods, and so on were slaughtered while under the protection of the freys at the orders of the lannisters/iron throne.

Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	but really, the lack of agreement you are seeing between economists is largely a narrative presented by media, much like the supposed lack of agreement on climate change.
Comparison of regular birth control pills and Plan B.	why should regular daily pill birth control be any different ?	plan b is a one time use of high dose progestagen designed to prevent establishment of a pregnancy by its negative feedback onto the hypothalamo pituitary unit to down regulate the hormone that is maintaining the corpus luteum or to prevent ovulation via the same mechanism.
Gotham City's Crime and Corruption.	the city is plagued by psychotic villains who steal and kill constantly, who seem to manipulate or break their way out of prison with fearful ease.	star city, central city, they all have their plagues.

Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	but if i asked them for a jagerbomb literally just a shot of jagermeister in a cup of red bull , they would give me a blank stare and say  a what ?   the other was a metal club that served so many jagerbombs they had their own cups made so that the shot of jager was held in the middle of the red bull and it mixed as you drank it.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	i may be able to find the x intercepts of a given quadratic equation and graph them, but do i really understand what the curve i am graphing means ? it is also entirely possible to be a smart student and get bad grades.

Misconceptions about the size of the USA and Europe.	i feel like many europeans really do not understand how large the usa is.	but if i go from new york to, i do not know, albuquerque or from lisbon to tallinn, of course it is  damn  far.
Teaching children about lies and authority figures.	l kids, or that spiderman exists, or that daniel radcliff really is a wizard.	in fact, we often take the time to explain to or that even parents can tell you a lie and you should not trust any authority figure.
Criticism of "offended culture" and charity donation priorities.	i feel like these people go around looking for something to be offended by, pick up on the actions of a few individuals and then extrapolate that to include every man ever.	should issues like child custody for fathers in the west be shoved aside in favour of other issues ? if a guy wants to campaign to see his kids more, is it fair for someone to tell him to shut up and support women in saudi arabia instead ? if a man is raped and told to man up and not be pathetic, should he not campaign for better treatment by society ? if a woman is raped and told she was dressed like a slut and asking for it, should she not be allowed to protest that treatment ? someone else will be able to do a much better job of it.
Philosophical Writing	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	if your view of poetry is just  hardship and love  i suggest branching out and delving into the huge breadth of work that exists ! if you want something artistic, i feel you should stick to art and other craft.

Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	gutting the unions has left us with no system to deal with an automated workforce.

Risk and uncertainty in life-saving decisions.	so gambling with a person a life without even guaranteeing the safety of others, is even less desirable.	you do not think they all have families as well ? do not you think that some of their primary reasons for joining the fireflies was to ensure the well being of their families ? i completely understand why joel made the decision he did, but that does not mean i think his decision was the right one.
Capitalism and its limitations.	for another, competition becomes impractical after a point; try starting an isp, or a car company, or a petrochemical company.	what should be done, then ? of course, we can do the same in a monarchy; it is called revolution.

Tipping and servers' wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	the idea of  servers make less than minimum wage  is misleading, and it is really frustrating when almost every comment i run into is someone claiming either they, or people they know do not make it.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	good luck with that.
The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	well, let is just say there would suddenly be a lot of vacant positions, including those in the hierarchy.
Opposing view on the biological basis of homosexuality.	i do not discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.	 so gay marriage should be allowed.
The obsession with sports players in American culture.	americans fetishize players in order to keep the masses obsessing over the nostalgia attached with players.	americans as in the public in general, aka the masses ? in other words the masses are forcing the masses to do something ? and is not obsessing over players the same as  fetishizing players  ? what is the point of watching sports ? to enjoy it ? but is not that exactly what they are giving them when  they paid him because laker nation likes him.
Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	! i guess people were talking about marijuana or mdma when they said much worse products are available, but i mean obviously heroin and methamphetamine are worse for you than a glass of scotch and a cigarette.
Debate: Dog vs. Cat as a Household Pet	i believe that when looked at objectively, a dog is a better potential companion in a household as a pet than a cat.	the truth of it the pet being superior is reliant upon the attitudes and preferences of the owner.

Individuality and Equal Opportunity in Society	i do not want the same as others, i want a chance to fulfill my own dreams and objectives.	their spending power goes down, and yours goes up.
Withdrawal from Cannabis Classification on Website	while withdrawal from cannabis has absolutely no drawbacks.	URL if these  programs  are factually telling students what classification they are in, i would hardly call that brainwashing.
Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	notice that this type of atheism makes no claim to knowledge about the existence of a god, just that they find it easier to imagine the lack of something than the existence of something unexplainable.
The depletion of fuel for planes.	planes need fuel, literally tons of it, simply to function.	we are already working on synthesizing sustainable versions of fossil fuels using crops and microorganisms.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	put on some clothes ? controlling nature.
Atheism and the Path to Finding God	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	but you have just outlined the reasons atheists do not believe in god.

Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	robert was a likeable guy, and how did he do ? it is not a reality distortion, it is an acceptance of reality.

Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	he wanted all of europe and russia.
Personal stance on controlled substance use.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	that being said, there is nothing inherently better about having certain experiences sober, so if one can provide a certain context for some experiences by getting high, then what exactly is the problem ? it is arguable that by being sober all the time and refusing the possibility of ever doing recreational drugs, one is living life on the default settings and is refusing to expand and push the boundaries of their experience.
Gender stereotypes in media portrayal of romantic relationships.	women are often portrayed in the media as being very concerned about romantic love and men as commitment phobes more interested in sex.	what makes you think this ? do women  say  this ? if not, what makes you think that they do not live up to their portrayal in the media ? do you think it would be evidence  for  romantic love if women were  less  picky ? or at least, they fall in love quicker and more deeply than women.
Same-sex marriages in a life simulation game.	there is a work around that allows same sex marriages, which is to make a male character a female or vise versa.	women in madden would be amazing, and i see legitimate reason to not have a simple  skin color  slider in animal crossing, especially since the game is all about customization.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	we should not teach children to follow their dreams, we should teach them how to survive in this world.
Frustration with the American welfare system and desire to play games.	why ca not i just fuck the world and ask for the social welfare payment and play every days some good mmorpg games huh ?	it is pretty miserable.
Career expectations in the arts.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	yes but then your dream is not to be artist.
The path to finding God through trust/faith versus enlightenment.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	note: i am agnostic not an atheist exactly because there is no evidence against a god.
Debate on the role of evidence in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	would not it be silly to create a world, then give man sensors to see and touch evidence and a brain to comprehend the evidence of the world and himself and then say  but for believing in  me , you must  stop  using the method for which i endowed you to know what exists and what is true and what is real.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	if you do not like novels, do not keep watching the wire.

The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	yeah, it is an important part but it is not the  defining  part of religion.
Society's tendency towards outrage culture.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	why not ? what should offend me ? i do not understand being offended by one person is opinion.
Arguments against maximum salary and financial motivation.	i am not that interested in counter arguments about how impractical such a change is/would be.	be that as it may, if i am an executive that generated $m /yr for a $b/yr company, knows the company and its founders/head decision makers inside out and would take the company years and  millions of dollars  to replace me, why would the company want to only pay me peanuts $k/yr  of revenue peanut shavings for this and redistribute the cash to people that are easily replaceable and not as essential ?.
Living abroad and cultural perspective of the USA.	i am an american and will always consider the usa my home, but i have lived in europe now for an extended period of time.	as our ability to participate in society has a much larger affect on the quality of life, our desire to ensure society treats minorities with respect is far greater.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	using the us dollar is a choice you make.
***Possible topic: The threat of infectious diseases.	we are overdue for a severe plague.	if one is seriously concerned about nuclear weapons, one should also be particularly concerned about events in the last few months: at the end of the cold war, the various former soviet states gave up their nukes in exchange for various promises from russia and the us.

Controversy surrounding the use of the word "redskin"	first off when has anyone every heard the word redskin outside of talking about the professional football team ?	an  you two dirty, cutthroat, redskin thieves, you can get out of town as fast as ye know how, or i will have ye jugged.
Uncertainty about future career path.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	there are plenty of kids who did not know they had an interest in chemistry, or physics, etc.

Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	chess grandmaster is not a pinnacle of human intelect.
Views on Hierarchy and Equality in Society	i like hierarchy, and find leadership and social status motivating.	people having what they need and what they are willing to work for does not stop you from having the same opportunity to exceed the basics with hard work.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	is that not to be expected given our progressive tax system ? if you are paying more than the median income in taxes then you are earning  far  more than the median income.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	ever read oscar wilde is   the picture of dorian gray  ? it follows through on the premise of the amoral man.
Identifying personal strengths.	my strengths lie in literature and english.	i do not mean this to sound rude at all, but at  you likely do not actually know what your strengths are yet.

Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	anything else is a bonus.

Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	where did you come up with that idea ? being good at chess does not mean you are smart.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	nor can you expect them to keep them in memory if they are never actually ordered, and thus never come up.
Character description.	instead he chose the way of evil magic and became a kinslayer.	so was robb, who beheaded a karstark.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	sure, in much the same thing that everything you experience using any type of digital computer is a bunch of ones and zeros.

Misinterpretation of the phrase "I do not care"	even here, i would argue that the narrator does actually care about the consequences of her actions just not the consequences that most people would be thinking about when their car is totaled.	is there any reason to believe that she is not referring exclusively to the fact that she does not care about her car ? given the context, that seems much more likely to me.
Gotham City's Crime and Corruption.	the city is plagued by psychotic villains who steal and kill constantly, who seem to manipulate or break their way out of prison with fearful ease.	he may want to think so, it fits his persecution complex, but that is just his own failings coming to bear.
The limitations of deriving meaning from criminal behavior.	that being said, to try to derive anything exceptionally deep or meaningful about society from any of these things i do not think is particularly useful.	exploding stars tell us a lot about the non exploding ones.
Tattoos and their significance.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	if you are saying that you find tattoos to be a form of superficial exhibitionism, i ca not disagree with you, but so is anything in the louvre, by that logic.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	there are radios, televisions and newspapers in sweden.
Concealed Handguns and their Necessity.	even if you have a concealed handgun, there still really is not a reason for it.	where do you pull that conclusion from ? who is going to protect me ? the sever with the spoon of justice ? where is that tid bit of fact come from ?.
Libertarianism and Social Liberalism	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	libertarians simply do not support government handouts, affirmative action, and messing with the  invisible hand of the marketplace.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	and even the lowest estimates i have seen for self defense uses of guns have outpaced the murder rate by a factor of .
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	not everything.
Criticism of libertarianism's impact on poverty and prejudice.	libertarianism leads to more poverty, blocks the prevention of racism and other prejudice, and ensures that poor people have little hope of escaping their plight.	are federal prisons less violent than state prisons ? you have simply assumed this without justification.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	is that not to be expected given our progressive tax system ? if you are paying more than the median income in taxes then you are earning  far  more than the median income.
Benefits of being single vs being in a relationship.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	usually, the benefit you get from being in the relationship far outweighs the temporary pain from a possible breakup.
Offensive policies and societal reactions to offense.	i understand finding racial profiling or stop and frisk offensive, policies that actually impact your life that are sanctioned by the state.	and yet you do realize that there would be people who would be offended by that, right ? and we live in a society where an honest statement of offense is often met by a feigned counter reaction that is itself outraged.
Tipping and servers' wages.	if you want servers to make a living wage, stop funding the vicious circle.	i will copy and paste exactly what /u/ppmd said in these comments so there will be two places people can run into it:   if a server does not make minimum wage over the period of his pay check, the restaurant is obligated by law to bring him up to minimum wage.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	you have to find a way to live that is congruent with your beliefs and values, and if you do that, even if you still feel fear you will also feel fulfilment.
Opinions on Acting Skill and Roleplaying.	i find bad acting very cringey, and i do not act well so trying out roleplaying/watching other people act badly does not appeal to me.	others just narrate what their characters are doing in the rd person.
Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	trans people, just like gay people since gay people have more legal issues on our radar than just marriage equality , have yet to be established as a legally protected class in the us, so they legally can be denied service, employment, and housing in certain scenarios both groups are legally protected on the federal level and in some states.
Religion and Evil People.	evil, twisted people, but still just mortal people.	while true, it is irrelevant to whether religion/dogma is good or bad.
Immorality of not paying taxes.	and if you do not participate fully, you are an immoral person ?	it could be, if you believe that breaking the law under any circumstance is immoral.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	atheists are merely waiting to be convinced of god is existence.
Criticism of the free market and Luxottica's business practices.	that is not how the free market should work.	if not, then there is enough of a demand for their product and no one is getting screwed over.
The meaning of "God" in the context of religion.	change my view that god should represent the shared human concept of existence for people who claim to be religious, as anything less thought out than that basically implies that the word  god  has no more meaning within the framework of our reality.	the fact that you disagree with modern religions is not a good enough justification to hijack their terminology and reshape it for your own worldview.
Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	in some places it just denotes the difference between the wet season and the dry season.
Difficulty with chemistry conversion problems.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	but you have given one example of one lesson in chemistry.
Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	tax cuts can easily be used as incentives with strings.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	his mother removes the most critical asset robb had in the war, and he essentially slaps her on the wrist for it his mother was also the reason the riverlands sided with robb, and his only shot at potentially getting the vale.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	yeah some people do but statistically speaking, most people do not.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	it also shoots a hole in your argument when most of the network building that private companies of done for the internet came from grants and funds from the government to help them build out the networks.
Chopsticks and their practicality.	but for practically everything else, there is just no god damn reason to use chopsticks when western utensils are more practical, and better for the environment.	actually, the chinese were taught to use chopsticks long before spoons and forks were invented in europe the knife is older, not as an instrument for dining but as weapon.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	require at least decent math skills.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	you can easily move to one of the liberal cities in america and experience the hipsterish environment you describe.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	and pressure ? yeah, parents pressure children to do lots of things.
Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	radar and sonar, pretty much everything we know about the ocean is because of world war , our understanding of the ocean could save our planet one day.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	well, you are just flat out wrong there, a little conversation with vint cerf if you are going to discuss the internet you should know who he is shows that government gets the credit URL the credit for the internet and tcp/ip which runs it goes to vint cerf and bob kahn working in the arpa project which was funded and run by the government.
Origins and significance of "Deutschlandlied"	deutschlandlied is a song of unity, peace, and brotherhood from the very first stanza.	the first stanza does not make sense ever since the dream of a grossdeutscheland died when prussia purposely excluded austria from becoming part of the german empire.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	the first technological manuals was early scripture, the first medical texts were books like the talmud.
Comparison of eating habits between smokers and non-smokers.	i think the difference is mostly visceral, and stems from the fact that eating food is viewed by most as pleasurable whereas a non smoker is unable to understand the craving of a smoker.	this means that they cannot go cold turkey for any significant periods of time.
Correlation between test scores and preparation methods.	however, there is a very strong correlation between act/sat scores and the amount of time/money put into preparing for them.	the scores are biased, but not based on how much time/money is put into them.
Boomer Presidents and Their Vice Presidents.	we have only had three boomer presidents: bill clinton, george w.  bush, and barack obama.	this is not about presidents, this is about ceos, lobbyists, and congressmen.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	the definition of  well regulated  at the time that amendment was written is explained at this resource with examples URL as  functioning within expected parameters.
Parenting strategies.	the actual difficulty just comes from figuring out what kind of strategy you want to utilize to raise your kid.	after you figure that out, everything falls into order.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	this may be your dream, but not everyone cares about making  figures and thus not everyone necessarily dreams of making  figures.
Negative impact of colonialism on third world countries.	the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	to not have a larger nation profit from your national resources the wealth generally flows to the colonizer is great.
Outdated beliefs and animal population control.	the archaic belief in people returning to life, and even the belief that dead would feel insulted if not  properly respected  is outdated and a fallacy.	why throw out all caskets instead of advocating a certain type ? you could also say the same about  natural balance  and spiritual natural connections.
Comparison of two bars.	anyone can be trained to make these drinks in less than an hour.	i could get a blue motorcycle, zombie, or a whiskey sour.
Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	creating jobs is  rarely  in the interests of a corporation, wages are expensive they will look at any alternative possible first.
The role of religion in preventing evil and war.	there would still be wars, there would still be people who rose to positions of power for their own benefit.	this too is irrelevant, because there is not a  single  tangible, real life benefit that religion and dogmatic beliefs provide that cannot be achieved through purely secular means.
Minimum standards for basic needs and freedom to pursue goals.	minimum standards which no one is allowed to go below would be desirable imo, such as access to sanitation, nutritional needs met, basic health care, education and so forth.	i find that to be unreasonable.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	not at all.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	to quote the man himself:  when your enemies defy you, you must serve them steel and fire.
The importance of science in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	but for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	it would be strange to create an additional  band tax  that the band  as a whole  pays in addition to their individual taxes.
Smoking and its rationality.	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	whether or not their use of tobacco makes sense to you or is rational.
Disadvantages of smoking and the issue of respect.	i ca not see any reason for a rational person to smoke.	this misconception comes from bad parents who smoke in their house and around their kids, those children are the only people other than the smoker who can receive significant harm, and you ca not blame that on smokers as a whole at least without also blaming all people who enjoy a beer the same as you would blame a drunk driver.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	this is silly and irrelevant, some sort of bizarre false analogy not worth exploring.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	then following your dreams would be to figure out the best way to make  figures in the art field.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	as others have pointed out, it is not a ponzi scheme.
Misconceptions about the size of the USA and Europe.	i feel like many europeans really do not understand how large the usa is.	i believe you americans often underestimate the size of europe in relation to the us.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	they would have probably cut a deal with tywin.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	french is easy to learn if your native language is spanish.
Proper use of chopsticks for eating delicate food.	you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	this is a result of your inexperience with them.
Gender stereotypes in media portrayal of romantic relationships.	women are often portrayed in the media as being very concerned about romantic love and men as commitment phobes more interested in sex.	again, can you tell us where you are coming from ? personal experience ? some set of statistics ? it obviously ca not be the portrayal of men or women in the media because you are arguing  against  those stereotypes being accurate.
Sexual exclusivity in trust agreement.	why is sexual exclusivity part of the general trust agreeement ?	if  months into our relationship, one of us had been unfaithful, the relationship would not have lasted.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	the thing you are missing is that  the standards   are not actually standard  and because there is a  huge  variant in the clientele from bar to bar, there is no reason why there should be any overlap on what a bartender who works at a classy cocktail bar knows versus a bartender from a metal club, aside from one bartender working at both types of bar in their career.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	otherwise they just end it in a tie.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	one of them catered to a more classy clientele, lots of suits and dresses in the bar, and there were lots of those sorts of cocktails.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	using stereotypes is a terrible way to determine requirements.
Career expectations in the arts.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	i think making your hobby into a job will  make you very little money for the time you spend  make you hate your hobby because a job is always going to be more restrictive than a hobby  a lot of college students go into less lucrative degrees because they came straight out of high school and do not realize the truth about being an adult with day to day expenses.
Discipline and Spanking in Children's Behavior.	kids these days are unruly and need to be taught discipline !	should we therefore regulate how much money you need to have to care for children ?.
Morality of paying taxes.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	it has to be done under the rule of law, i.
The difficulty of winning the war against terrorism.	we could literally blow up every remaining terrorist, and we still would have lost the war.	his only sense of  justice  that was taught to him.
Effects of Spanking on Children's Thinking and Behavior	spanking does not encourage critical thinking: child a:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy will hit me  child b:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy explained x will happen.	did not you just say children do not have the ability to think critically ? critical thinking is not the goal.
Software failures in vehicles.	why the point as software failures, malfunctions or whatever would mean you ca not go anywhere.	actually self driving cars will potentially lower emissions by having cars draft one another at distances that human drivers would be able to do.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	you think some high school dropout with no education thought of that ? or look into your medicine cabinet, you think people without education created those antibiotics ? human history has been a constant advancement in science and technology.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	caring for people you either do not naturally care about, or may even feel animosity toward is not an easy thing for most people.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	i firmly believe that one should consider others as well as oneself.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	what do we do ? just because we may understand a situation does not mean we will have the same solution.
Morality and Personal Associations.	that does not make a person a shitty human being.	i will not associate with an amoral person.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	if they do not feel like unattractive failures every time they step out of the house, they would be more comfortable exercising in the same sense that you would feel more comfortable tightrope walking if there is a net below you.
The impact of animals on human survival.	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	if certain animals go extinct, it could have very bad effects on the ecosystems, therefore harming us.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	you can sucumb to that challenge or you can seek to rise above it.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	the usual methods do not work any more when temperatures and humidity go high enough, drinking enough water would not help, fans would feel more like hair dryers,.
Risks and Rewards of Teenage Sex.	however, i feel like the risks of sex as a teenager far outweigh the rewards.	the bottom line is that kids are going to have sex whether or not you tell them how to do it safely.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	you do not know because it did not happen to you.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	this is the rub: if they decided to do this, two problems would arise: one, me and people like me would confront their force with force.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	that is actually provable, and can be observed to have fallen since leaded gasoline was restricted.
The usefulness of converting moles of oxygen into grams.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	you might need chemistry to know that some things are flammable, and some things are not.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	it is the great gatsby of our generation.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	what is grinkle ? a.
The path to finding God through trust/faith versus enlightenment.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	god is no different.
The positive impact of religion on society.	i feel like the amount of charity people give to the world in the name of their faith more than balances these rare incidents.	generally, when people say  religion is bad , they mean dogmatic beliefs are bad.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	each person who works in/with that band earns money for it and pays taxes on what they make.
Preference between cats and dogs as pets.	cats, even when used to human contact, will frequently attack a human without reason as  play .	this depends on the temperament of the cat, and while many cats may lash out, at least they probably wo not kill the person when they do.
Effectiveness of Advertising.	i have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.	in any case, its information you store away for when you are weak and it pops up.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	the movement needs momentum to be effective, and it needs momentum to be appealing enough to gain momentum.
Identity and the effects of drugs/alcohol on perception.	i have observed that while high/drunk users exhibit and/or report that their emotions, perceptions, thought processes, behavior, and memory are altered, if only temporarily.	if anything, one should see an identity rather as a sort of graph over time.
The obsession with sports players in American culture.	americans fetishize players in order to keep the masses obsessing over the nostalgia attached with players.	so why is klinsmann complaining ?.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	how have you become  weaker mentally and physically, and less capable  than yourself, before you got the bike ?.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	as for any  loop holes  well those are our fault, if they are a problem we will work to close them.
Affirmative Action Policy	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	if you are used to see people with certain traits in power and those traits prove to be irrelevant, you wo not expect those traits to be a problem.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	thus letting google or anybody else co opt it would be worse for the public, and since google, nor anybody else, has not been given the right to such control, the rest of us can speak out against them.
Anti-Semitic sentiment during wartime.	hostilities against the jews were more intense because of the war.	to say that  he did not want war  this is what started wwii as we know it, not the holocaust.
Disagreeing with Webster's Dictionary and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.	disagreeing with webster is dictionary and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.	russel is tea pot is a thought experiment to elucidate why burden of proof is on the one making a claim, and that rejection of a claim is not by necessity a claim itself.
Philosophical Writing	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	no other restrictions.
Perception of oneself as a statistic.	i take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.	i am directing this thought at mass education as a whole because i dropped out of middle school, then high school, and then college.
Awareness of Jesus and religious persecution during the Holocaust.	obviously every single adult in a western country has heard of jesus already, and has had the opportunity to convert.	lastly, they honestly do not mean to bother you, most of the time if you are not interested they will leave.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	ww was not a war against jewish genocide and, if anything, hostilities against the jews were more intense because of the war.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	rich people will still want to be special, so the best genes will be prohibitively expensive while the rest of us get lesser genes.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	some of the messages i have gotten on that site.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	unlike other sports that allow regular substitutions or, in the case of mlb, there is minimal physical activity.
Awareness of Jesus and religious persecution during the Holocaust.	obviously every single adult in a western country has heard of jesus already, and has had the opportunity to convert.	but think of it from their pov.
Debate on the importance of animal species conservation.	i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	they are going to be actively harmed during the process, same with humans.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	it is simply not worth it.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	and thank the gods for it.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	a few comments in your description intrigued me:  appalled by capitalist and consumer culture, i disposed of my radio and television in  and have never purchased a newspaper or periodical.
Animal exploitation and consent argument.	the only way the consent argument can be strong is if you are arguing from the standpoint we should not exploit animals period.	on the flip side if you are talking about someone fucking a sheep well that really only benefits that one guy.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	that is just my choice, and i also support the choices of people who decide to boycott chipotle over this decision.
Outdoor storage options.	can be left outside if need be.	training wise all sorts of animals can be trained to do things.
Voting based on name recognition in politics.	people vote for the name, not the views of the person.	that is wrong and i feel that it is a horrible thing for the country.
The role of religion in preventing evil and war.	there would still be wars, there would still be people who rose to positions of power for their own benefit.	while true, it is irrelevant to whether religion/dogma is good or bad.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	while a esl student might understand people with a standard british accent, they may still have trouble understanding a scottish, cockney, australian or american accent.
Doubting the practicality of learning moles to grams conversion.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	i cannot think of a time when any of this will become useful to me.
***Difficulties in discussing sensitive social topics in the US.	with all efforts to educate myself on topics such as obamacare, transgender, along with other major social topics in the us, there was always someone to  put me in my place  because of how much i offended them.	this makes it seem like some of your problems arise from your personal experiences, which not having seen, the rest of us ca not really ascertain them very much.
Advantages of Neutral and Fixed Money.	in particular, i see a neutral and fixed money as being superior and offering many advantages over what we currently use.	gold/dollars/euros/etc.
Bad decision making and quitting smoking.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	it is a  constant struggle  where you  need  to keep a cold head and strictly control your food input.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	this is common sense which every consumer is supposed to have.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	will the new hire generate more value for the company than his salary ? if yes: hire; if no: do not.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	stem is not the only thing in the world people should learn.
Impact of British Empire on Third World and Hitler's Expansion Plans.	but the british empire was the largest and the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	do you have any evidence to suggest this is true ? hitler explicitly stated that the german empire needed to expand to austria, czechoslovakia, and poland, at least.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	when we condone one aspect of risk taking behavior, such as casual sex, we also condone other forms of risk taking behavior, such as drugs and gambling.
Relationship between religion and science.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.	religion, however, either separates itself from science, or directly opposes it.
Training dogs for different purposes.	dogs can be trained to smell cancer, sense danger, lead the blind or disabled, or simply do a number of amusing tricks.	i also respect the independence of cats.
Collective action and political influence for social change.	the people can collectively rise up and overthrow those with unjust power.	soon, they are lobbying to elect politicians and influence public opinion, altering foreign policy.
Smoking and societal attitudes towards it.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	even still the damage had been done.
Eliminating the use of the word "potential" in reference to humans.	as a last point, what else, if not a human ?	this is like a caterpillar is a potential butterfly.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	spanking is one such punishment.
Introverts' discomfort with extroverts' questioning.	i have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being  forced to talk  by being asked questions.	in other words, sometimes the most extreme introvert will be extremely outgoing.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	but the only way to end gun violence is to treat guns the way we currently treat marijuana another issue entirely : search and destroy.
***Possible topic: The threat of infectious diseases.	we are overdue for a severe plague.	some of these are more problems than others.
The role of faith in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	this loop of faith is stable once initiated, but many people do not want to get into it.
Fear of eternity in afterlife.	the fear in afterlife has existed because the idea of eternity seems so strange and uncommon in the world we live in.	period.
Offensive policies and societal reactions to offense.	i understand finding racial profiling or stop and frisk offensive, policies that actually impact your life that are sanctioned by the state.	why not ? what should offend me ? i do not understand being offended by one person is opinion.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	see, this makes sense now, you are not very familiar with what a  tax cut  for corporations means.
Reading habits of Reddit users.	most reddit users skim comments at best and do not bother to read low enough or read down voted threads.	you look at that and assume that because people are not running all the way down the page, they are tacitly approving of the racism that they do not know is there.
Theoretical limits of modeling particles in the universe.	theoretically speaking, if methuselah lived long enough and had enough clay tablets he could perform all of the calculations necessary to model all of the particles in the universe.	we just do not know currently what the requirements are, and to claim otherwise is to assert something without evidence.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	it is nothing but a ponzi scheme.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	that is because corporate tells managers that they should cave in the wishes of their customers because  the customer is always right.
Stannis' strategy and character in Game of Thrones.	stannis could make the best of his situation backing renly, who would then together with robb crush lannisters from all sides.	besides, once renly was out of the picture, he had several major houses line up with him.
Hunting and its impact on wildlife conservation.	hunters have been responsible for the extinction of wildlife in recent memory and in past events of human existence.	seasons are constructed in such a way that only overpopulated species are hunted and that only a certain number will be killed.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	i do not think anyone should claim to know how either of these traits are determined most studies done find that there is no proof at all that men are  inherently  more aggressive than women but rather than society ingrains aggressiveness as something men need to perform into them, same for competitiveness.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	the only purpose of tobbaco is that teenagers think it is cool.
Debate on the definition of atheism.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	that is not something i have said.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	also, you ca not even begin to imagine the economic damage caused by lost tax revenue from tobacco sales and the loss of jobs in tobacco country.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	it also has a national professional league.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	but going back to the first point, spanking is largely used at stages where critical thinking is not possible.
Comparison of science and religion in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	most european scholars until recently were driven by their faith to explore the mysteries of the universe in hope of learning more about god and his creation.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	this implies that consciousness is something unobservable, and that a thing without consciousness will act indistinguishably from a thing that has consciousness.
Federal government's control and protection.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	except for specific circumstances like crossing state lines or doing these things on federal property they are not under the purview of the federal govt.
Federal government's control and protection.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	so are you saying the federal govt.
The value of questioning and uncertainty in learning and confidence.	in my experience, i have learned so much more by questioning what i already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself.	i also believe that this is reprehensible.
***Possible topic: The threat of infectious diseases.	we are overdue for a severe plague.	the more recent nuclear states like north korea, india, pakistan and israel must be very aware of this at this point.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	you have the reasoning wrong.
Men's primary concern: Romantic Love.	men, however  do  have romantic love as their primary concern.	why not ? it is hard to argue against something if we have no idea why you hold it.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	i believe that any one instance of male dominated game or movie with no three dimensional female characters or someone with an above average bmi does not imply that that instance is sexist or sexist or fat , necessarily.
Smoking and its justifications.	tell me why i should not enjoy myself by smoking at the end of every day.	just be careful, do not get caught.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	but the boomers have, by and large, failed to adapt.
STEM vs Arts education	i realize that some people will say  oh, you do not want to be uncultured !	there are movies and books detailing every second of that moment  because  we ca not forget.
Success and Personal Capability	i am defining better here as how well equipped i am to be successful in achieving my goals in life.	of all the people whose goal is to survive cancer, some succeed and others do not.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	basically i do not really care about your view on whether the us should just  stay out of the whole thing like they do already.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	it is difficult enough to get a business going with marketing, but putting marketing limits would really hurt the small businesses whose brands are not yet known.
The ethics of giving to the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	if you do not respect the idea of property, then you should be fine with sharing everything you have.
Inconsistencies in Wolverine's claws in different movies.	you remember at the end of the wolverine when logan loses his metal claws and regrows the cool as fuck bone claws ?	in that period of time, he got metal claws back.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	besides, in a friends with benefit style relationship, people presumably trust their partner to tell them if they have an std, making this a much smaller risk  secondly, it is unproductive and time wasting, and can lead to other even more unproductive and costly behaviors like binge drinking and internet addiction browsing hookup sites.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	libertarians i know are also very into creating private scholarships to help kids pay for college.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	very frequently their native language has little in common in english  a lot of people learn english to speak it in a professional setting.
Philosophy of Existence and Reality.	there is one, huge nothingness behind us, lies in peace and waiting for us at the end.	let is consider just these two options.
Frustration with the American welfare system and desire to play games.	why ca not i just fuck the world and ask for the social welfare payment and play every days some good mmorpg games huh ?	you can get supplemental income, but you have to have a good reason for not working and have a work history.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	the definition of  well regulated  at the time that amendment was written is explained at this resource with examples URL as  functioning within expected parameters.
Importance of Proper Communication in Job Interviews	i am pretty sure i could not have even gotten an interview if i spoke like lil  montrell up the street haha.	in my observations, i have noticed that what a lot of people think of as  black culture  and actual black culture are as different as apples and oranges.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	it can cost $ just to move a single person from coast to coast.
Same-sex parenting and its potential impact on children.	on top of that, having two same sex parents could cause a kid to be bullied in school or maybe even be pressured into living a similar lifestyle.	none of us can address this, not knowing you.
Chopstick etiquette and soup slurping.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	why would you be judged ? who does that ? not true.
Uncertainty about future career path.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	there are plenty of kids out there who feel that they have no need for the skills you learn in high school english, and would much rather take more science classes in a field that they want to go into.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	therefore, a  well regulated militia  is a militia that is performing its function ie: being a defensive force for the homeland of the country  they are a tool designed specifically for killing, unlike the other two.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	for example, european scholars for much of european history from the middle ages onward believed that understanding the natural world was a key step in understanding god, that a rational god made a rational world that could be rationally described.
Issues with Overtime Structure in NHL and NFL.	at worst, just schedule a rematch the next day, anything to actually give me a definitive conclusion.	brazil croatia could end their game today at  , for example.
Marriage and its purpose.	i am going to save a lot of time and money by not being in one.	live your life they way you want.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	i am not sure if philosophy and political science are the best majors if you want to make a lot of money.
Evaluation of Robert's Leadership Qualities.	and suffers from massive reality distortion field which gets him into fights he cannot win.	renly was like robert, and robert was a bad king.
Responsibility and Authority in Children's Behavior	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	the goal is listening to the parents, and doing what they say, and not talking back.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	unjustified confidence can be dangerous, but it is perfectly fine if there is a rational reason for it.
Government's role in marriage.	which made me ask, why the government was even involved in marriage in the first place.	because it is beneficial for the government for you to live a stable and happy life that does not create expenses and burdens for the rest of us.
Anti-Semitic sentiment during wartime.	hostilities against the jews were more intense because of the war.	he invaded in .
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	denial is not more reasonable than fanaticism of faith when evidence is lacking.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	it would no longer be possible to live in most of the world without advanced technology, it would be simply too hot to live.
Capitalism and its limitations.	for another, competition becomes impractical after a point; try starting an isp, or a car company, or a petrochemical company.	even if they did, they might not have that ambition.
Opposing view on the biological basis of homosexuality.	i do not discriminate against homosexuals but the fundamentals behind gay marriage and rights are based on the idea that being gay is not a choice.	 there is not a biological basis for being gay.
Net neutrality and private company control.	tl;dr: net neutrality is nice, but i do not think the public truly has a right to control private companies.	does the public not have the right to reciprocity ?.
Fantasy character interactions and offspring.	if two of the characters get married, i want to see the ridiculous offspring of my roommate and jennifer lawrence for example.	you could just have children for gay couples as well and have it be part of the silliness.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	either it works, and works strongly enough to enact change, or  terms later the political climate has changed and it just about never happened.
Men's Difficulty in Attracting Women and Female Preferences.	the way that there are so many websites/communities sole dedicated to how to pick up women, which leads me to the conclusion that lots of men have trouble attracting women.	ex: i had a guy ask me out at the gym recently and he was not the most attractive guy ever, but that is not why i turned him down.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	i risk my life every day when i cross the road.
The concept of free will and its derivation.	the lack of free will can be derived from first principles, can be deduced from philosophy. or from physics. or from chemistry. or even simply neurobiology.	science will never teach that  man is choices and actions are futile.
Importance of learning unfamiliar concepts in education.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	how can you every understand it if you never participate in it and how can you know you will never have an interest in it if you never attempt to understand it ?.
Science vs. Bible on Earth's Age	science has contradicted the bible on several occasions.	he explains that ancient cultures were not concerned about the material existence of something, they were concerned about the function.

Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	would we have ever thought to go to the moon if we had not imagined going first ?.
Outrage culture and privilege.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	apparently they are all terrorist towel heads that hate america.
Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	stannis would do that.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	teens will do this whether or not they have vehicles, so it is important that they learn the consequences of doing these and then driving sooner rather than later.
Fear of Eternal Sleep.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	that is what changed my mind about wanting immortality.
Pizza sizes and confusion.	my point is that when places like dominos and pizza hut sell you s, m, l pies, you have no way to know what you are getting.	they are not trying to hide it from you as the information is readily available when you go to order, and if you are behind the times and still use a phone to order pizza i am certain they would tell you if you ask.
Subjectivity of opinions on musicians and people.	there are loads of better musicians and many more interesting people.	do you really think one direction has enough creative talent to write/perform innovative music that changes the course of music history ? of course not.
Alternative treatments for gender dysphoria.	fix your dysphoria without going through a potentially disastrous and expensive series of surgeries etc.	it might be possible, but that is not an issue which is worth spending a lot of money on.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	this makes no sense.
Clarifying the distinction between hard and soft atheism.	atheists often dispute that these are separate categories, speaking of hard and soft atheism.	agnosticism, uncertainty, or skepticism can all be aspects of atheism.
The role of religion in preventing evil and war.	there would still be wars, there would still be people who rose to positions of power for their own benefit.	without religion, evil people would not stop being evil.
Judgment towards drug preferences.	nobody should be judged differently to a drinker for preferring lsd or mdma.	this is basically the case already, just not law.
Gender identity and transition options.	i feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the  i feel like i should have been male/female  argument.	it just feels wrong, you believe yourself to be a man, but you are constantly treated as a woman, and it just does not feel right.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	the worst diplomatic blunder, was attempting to appease hitler.
Personal stance on controlled substance use.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	this is because some people do drugs to gain new experiences and insights about life.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	weather paterns would change considerably and great many people would have to migrate.
Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	b the classes of the militia are   the organized militia, which consists of the national guard and the naval militia; and  the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the national guard or the naval militia.
The nature of evidence and how it relates to God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	why would we ? is there anything you believe based on nothing ? surely you agree that we need at least  some  evidence to believe anything, you do not believe based on nothing right ? you have a bible, or a vision, or someone tells you something in a convincing way.
Smoking and societal attitudes towards it.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	cloves are a valid option, you will get all the physical sensations minus the nicotine.
Smoking and its rationality.	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	the majority of people who smoke today know they are harming themselves.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	why should an nhl team be allowed to play a mini game to determine who goes to the playoffs ? why should an nfl game end in a tie instead of determining a winner ? also, i should point out, in soccer there is only a shootout in a deciding game elimination/knockout games.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	in fact, i think crying is a healthy emotional release while misogyny is  the byproduct of bottling emotions up.
Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	one thing i learned recently is that in the state of oklahoma, for trans people to change their gender on their legal documents, they need a court order to do so, but actually getting a judge to sign a court order for this process is not as simple as requesting a judge for the order, wait a while, and then the judge will sign off on the order.
Comparing effects of cannabis and alcohol use.	cannabis also mellows you out, makes you more relaxed and heightens the imagination and improves creativity.	you can get addicted to lots of things.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it seems to me you are conflating a lot of things in this one statement.
Smoking and societal attitudes towards it.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	if you still feel that way, then you should probably learn more.
Career expectations in the arts.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	it is to be a wealthy artist.
Misunderstanding forum rules and guidelines.	failing to read either the op, or the instructions from the mods at the bottom.	when in doubt i believe it is best to assume good faith, however even then engaging something which is just fractally wrong, or worse not even wrong, can become tiresome.
Gender Equality and Chivalry	i do not think you can have gender equality and chivalry coexist.	girls like it.
Philosophical Writing	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	how many times has someone made you angry or elated or afraid merely with words ? language is the filter through which we experience our world.
Comparison of science and religion in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	with or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.
The deception of Santa Claus.	there is a real feeling that you have been lied to, because well you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.	are you saying that kids do not lie before they learn the truth about santa ? if they are sad it is because santa and all his magic elves and reindeers do not exist, not because they have been horribly deceived.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	net neutrality is about forcing an isp to treat all traffic the same regardless of source.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	you argue that all bartenders should know the  basics  just like all math teachers should know how to multiply and plumbers use a wrench.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	its not enough just to have the archive, we need to tell the story.
Comparing and contrasting two bars' cocktail menus.	you have cocktails on the menu you should know how to make the basics.	bitters are an essential ingredient.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	and people would have to live in enclosed buildings and not go outside most of the time, or live only in places like tibet or the arctic.
Discipline and Spanking in Children's Behavior.	kids these days are unruly and need to be taught discipline !	being born poor is also linked to all of those things.
The Definition of Atheism and Belief in Mythological Gods	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	denial is not more reasonable than fanaticism of faith when evidence is lacking.
Career expectations in the arts.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	a job is just that, a job.
Religious beliefs and uncertainty.	in sum, agnosticism, skepticism, or simply admitting ignorance is a reasonable response to lack of data.	this is ignoring the fact that you have chosen bad definitions from the start.
The distinction between hard and soft sciences.	there really is no  soft science  or  hard science , only good science, bad science and pseudo science.	reliability of information is not everything.
The depletion of fuel for planes.	planes need fuel, literally tons of it, simply to function.	who says we ca not developed new types of fuel ? maybe fossil fuels will run out in  to  years, but that does not mean that we wo not find other ways of producing the energy needed for flight.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	so think about the monopoly of force you would be giving this government who has been engaging in global espionage and the system which has, over the last  years, been quietly and slowly taking away freedoms via the patriot act and aforementioned prism.
Criteria for Involuntary Admission Scheduling.	note that criteria for involuntary admission scheduling varies between states and countries but generally includes risk of harm to self, or to others.	evidence existing does not equal evidence being readily available to the person or the individual being able to understand the evidence.
Federal government's power and control over minimum wage.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	gun rights ? also within the federal purview, especially when it comes to tracking across the whole country, but also with imports and exports.
Society's tendency towards outrage culture.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	you can eat what you like.
Disadvantages of smoking and the issue of respect.	i ca not see any reason for a rational person to smoke.	in this instance, the benefits outweigh the risk.
Trend of best-selling Wii games for casual players.	if you analyze the list of best selling games on the wii including wii sports, mario kart wii, wii sports resort, new super mario bros.	especially when you look at the fact that once you have brought those extra people to the console it is more likely for them to pick up additional games as they have already gotten over the initial cost of the machine.
Taxation and Wealth Redistribution for Large Corporations.	firstly, higher tax rates for large corporations would redistribute wealth in society, without greatly affecting the rich individuals in question.	it would make no sense to hit those homeowners with a mansion tax.
Challenges of Gender Reassignment.	if you get extensive body modifications then struggle to afford the hormones you need to feel like whatever gender you swapped to, i have little sympathy.	it is very difficult to explain.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	i can disagree with them while not providing alternatives.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	that is just one of many examples of how you ca not argue all or many religions are true.
Disadvantages of smoking and the issue of respect.	i ca not see any reason for a rational person to smoke.	ignoring the harm it might potentially do to my body a decade or more from now, i can take  to  minutes to smoke by myself and deal with my problems.
Gender identity and transition options.	i feel like my lack of sympathy stems from the  i feel like i should have been male/female  argument.	also, this URL might also be worth reading, trans people actually have different brain structures compared to cis people.
Sharing personal experience as a universal truth.	projecting your experience to everybody is a logical mistake.	every guy in my class admitted that has at least once watched a porn movie.
Disagreeing with Webster's Dictionary and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.	disagreeing with webster is dictionary and the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy.	at least, if you are honestly skeptical about your own beliefs.
Future MMORPG games and their immersive experience.	most of mmorpg games thats coming in future will be much better then what i have played before.	they have got better graphics, but i do not get any more enjoyment or immersion out of them than i did when civilization or tetris were new.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	they are not actually cutting down trees, but cutting bamboo which grows back really fast.
Sexual exclusivity in trust agreement.	why is sexual exclusivity part of the general trust agreeement ?	not strictly because of jealously, but because the other person would think  if i ca not even trust them not to fuck other people, how much can i really trust them ?.
Extreme views in atheism and religion.	i feel /r/atheism is an extreme side of atheism, and is as evil as an extreme religious sect.	op is view is a bit ridiculous and not well supported at all.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	we do not consistently dominate in any olympic sport besides basketball, though we are very competitive in many sports.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	a job is something that you devote a great deal of time to.
Description of a character's beliefs and personality traits.	but also due to his believe in a foreign god to whom he makes human sacrifices.	i do not follow the logic.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	its a response to a claim, given a situation where no further evidence for the existence of something, in this case climate change, then denial or skepticism is the default position.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	now, there is a hope that the north will be free from the ironborn raiders, and might be able to feed itself in the coming winter.
Physical effects of injury.	that is because the effects on the body can be physically scarring.	source ? it seems to me that the effects of waterboarding are largely psychological.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	school is the perfect system.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	imperialism ended due to the war, and i for one believe that was a very positive effect.
Religion and Community Importance.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	community is important.
Outdated beliefs and animal population control.	the archaic belief in people returning to life, and even the belief that dead would feel insulted if not  properly respected  is outdated and a fallacy.	some caskets will biodegrade.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	the us dollar has value, that value is not just built on your input alone.
Criticism of Robb Stark's Leadership	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	the leader was not performing the needs of the people so, much like eddard did, roose decided to remove a mad king.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	they make take some practice to use, but they are far from impractical.
The Definition of Atheism and Belief in Mythological Gods	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	right, you recognize a pattern, but do you believe in zeus ? not, do you believe that zeus is some sort of mythological theme that exists and might be shared among many human cultures.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	people who display confidence are often ignorant or at least preventing themselves from learning more, while those that celebrate and reward confidence are actively enabling this primitive behavior.
Evaluation of Robert's Leadership Qualities.	and suffers from massive reality distortion field which gets him into fights he cannot win.	robert may not have been obsessed with justice, but see what kind of a ruler he was ? you could argue his inbility to maintain relationships  is  a problem, and i would agree, but i do not think that is a disqualifier and it is inaccurate to say he cannot maintain a relationship with  anyone.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	that is good ! very often, though, that ideal involves some level of hard work and competence on the other person is part.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	dumb people make me uncomfortable.
Existence of phenomena and the role of an all-powerful God.	the existence of these phenomena would require an all powerful god to permit them.	if you read the book of genesis, you will see that he even performed some of these things noah is ark anyone ? there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	at this point, would they even be  your  kids ? at some point they will become so genetically dissimilar that it would not be right to claim them as coming from you.
Challenges of using chopsticks.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	in some cultures, including ones where chopsticks are prevalent, not slurping is considered impolite you are blaming a cultural difference outright.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	caring for everyone is not an ingrained human value.
Effectiveness of Advertising.	i have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.	for drug treatment, its for recognizing that there is a treatment for your problem.
Character description.	instead he chose the way of evil magic and became a kinslayer.	so is dany, who kills potential political allies a shortsighted, passionate mistake.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	this is where you are wrong.
The impact of a father on personal development.	for me, my relationship with my father is what shaped me to who i am today.	of course they can.
The role of faith in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	perhaps it will be so complex that we wo not see it for thousands of years, but unless god is just sitting on his ass for eternity, he will be doing something, and that something is theoretically detectable.
Libertarianism and Social Liberalism	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	i promise if you actually research you will find government intervention leads to more poverty and blocks the prevention of racism who was it who installed the jim crow laws again ? oh right.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	we say  i do not know  when it comes to unproven science.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	never ever look at the historical tax rates; look at tax revenue collected as a portion of gdp to see how no one used to pay taxes.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	i like to use the bechdel test URL or for a more mind bendy one bmi URL as analogies.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	teens learn this from their parents in some cases, and many adults do it too.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	or remittance payments from workers to their families.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	i do not disagree with this point.
The ideology of mathematics and physics.	the intellectual purity of mathematics and physics cannot be surpassed.	philosophy answers  why , science cannot answer this.
Federal government's power and control over minimum wage.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	same with wage equality.
Importance of STEM in contributing to society.	i think that stem science, technology, engineering, mathematics is the most important when becoming a better person to contribute to society.	you ca not deal in absolutes like that it does not help your argument.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it is both a romantic and sexual attraction to members of the same sex.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	i served in the military out of high school, attended a cheap state school first in my family to graduate college , and have been self employed for the last seven years.
Restaurant tipping policy.	i think the main issue i have is that servers pool their tips usually, so a bad server will still get an equal cut of the money compared to the best server there.	a quick poll of my server friends confirms that this is unusual at least where i live.
Google's search page ranking and public intervention.	does the public have a right to stop google from letting entities pay more to allow their results to show up higher on the search page ?	actually monopoly concerns have caused google to have to prove that companies cannot do that which is why all the paid advertisements are not part of the actual results.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	a gun allows for the proper escalation of force with less risk to the user.
Individuality and Equal Opportunity in Society	i do not want the same as others, i want a chance to fulfill my own dreams and objectives.	currently, a fraction of the population is aspirations are resulting in widespread inequality and unequal opportunity.
Comparison of regular birth control pills and Plan B.	why should regular daily pill birth control be any different ?	blood clot in brain stroke.
Discipline of children and spanking as a form of punishment.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	i agree that spanking should not be applied to those who are to young.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	the us dollar has value, that value is not just built on your input alone.
Debate on the morality of homosexuality.	that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	dies it state that sexual pleasure wrong ? if so, why is having sex for pleasure purposes wrong ? as an atheist, i ca not really see anything wrong with sexual pleasure, assuming that there is consent between all parties involved with it, and, assuming consent has been established, i do not see why any distinction between the content of the sexual pleasure in terms of morality.
The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	steven weinberg nonsense.
Negative effects of participation trophies on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	it is just as important for young children to learn that their hard work is appreciated as it is to learn that not everyone can win everything.
Job dissatisfaction and management issues.	my managers overlook how much i help the company and how loyal i am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, i  talk back  too much.	work on your communication skills and you might be promoted into a position that requires more communication and collaboration.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	that is just one of many examples of how you ca not argue all or many religions are true.
Empirical verification of God's existence through various methods.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.
Freedom of speech and the use of the word "oriental"	now i was just wondering why we ca not say the word oriental.	it is really not about how logical  you  feel it is.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	in the end, religion became an exit from responsibility and a syndrome of written words being incorrect.
The purpose of education.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	they wo not, but school in general especially college and high school is not about teaching you how to solve  a  problem, but how to solve many problems by relating them to things you already know.
Human fetus and the use of the word "potential".	human fetus is a stage in the life of a human being.	there is absolutely no reason to use the word potential.
Risk and uncertainty in life-saving decisions.	so gambling with a person a life without even guaranteeing the safety of others, is even less desirable.	assuming you kill the bare minimum of people to get to that point when playing the game, you still end up killing  fireflies.
Job dissatisfaction and management issues.	my managers overlook how much i help the company and how loyal i am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, i  talk back  too much.	some jobs require kissing ass, diplomacy, and other types of persuasion to get results.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	has your mind changed from  it is okay to teach boys not to cry  to  it is not okay to discourage crying  ? although this is armchair psychology i am practicing, i do not see how crying leads to misogyny.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	modern taxation in the us if far from a group of people collecting money for their own personal gain.
Equality vs. Equal Opportunity	being more equal to others is not exactly sexy or motivating.	the big problem i see with this is that it is expensive, and the people and corporations that you would have to hit up to pay for this are going to be very resistant to the idea.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	they ca not agree on the important things.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	no one will remember breaking bad ten years from now, but people will still watch the wire.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	a moral man would be at a serious dilemma.
Personal finances and taxes.	i currently pay more in taxes than the average us family makes in a year.	i still respect and agree with the general system of taxation.
Federal government's power and control over minimum wage.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	do you trust them more ? why ? do you think there have not been corruptions in state governments ? much of that abetted by a federal government refusing to do its job, and that has caused a great deal of suffering, and no, people could not just move out of it.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	the main function really, is to see who can handle the stress, and who can not.
Inappropriate clothing and sexualization of girls.	in my opinion these types of shorts reveal way to much.	just because it makes this match does not make you a pedophile.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	want mini pancakes ? easy.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	it too is valuable information.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	however, chopsticks reflect gentleness and benevolence, the main moral teaching of confucianism.
Beverage knowledge and specialization.	do i expect everyone to know every drink variant, no.	all bartenders should know the basics just like math teachers should know how to multiply and plumbers should know how to use a wrench.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	and a huge number of our foods are influenced by native american preparations.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	if you could not consent before you were x years, that is fine, but every person is different.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	it takes just around °c warming for the costs clearly outweigh the benefits.
The absence of a center of consciousness in the brain.	neuroscientists have studied the brain extensively and not found anything resembling a  center of consciousness  in the brain which actually causes our consciousness.	it is not blackness or nothingness; it is just nothing.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	confidence is neither a good or bad thing.
Opinions on recreational drug use.	to clarify, a recreational drug is like a filter for experiences.	drugs can provide a context for certain experiences that being sober is insufficient to do.
Using chopsticks.	if you do pick something up with them, you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	that should not happen.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	what you seem to be saying is that it is impossible to create a perfect simulation, but i am not sure why you believe that.
Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	you speak of the humidity, so you do not live in an arid environment.
Proper use of chopsticks for eating delicate food.	you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	just so you know, it is polite to slurp spaghetti, since it is more rude to not surp and let some fall back to the plate.
Causes of WWII and Lebensraum concept.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	the nazis were always aiming for war, their long term plans were built upon the conquest of new lands through military force.
Interest in moral, ethical, and philosophical issues.	i am more interested in the moral, ethical and philosophical issues rather than in practical ones.	you seem to want this but are afraid of it.
Testing humans and reliance on simulation.	there is no reason to test humans since god is all knowing.	there would effectively be fewer kinds of people; existence itself would be more uniform.
Debate on the role of evidence in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	would god want you to deny or dismiss the evidence of your own senses ? would god who endowed you with the powers of judgement and reason want you to believe every word in a text or every statement by an authoritative figure by blindly suspending that judgement and reason ? if there is a god, then he must be logical and rational.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	 of them specializes in fishing.
Taxation and Wealth Redistribution for Large Corporations.	firstly, higher tax rates for large corporations would redistribute wealth in society, without greatly affecting the rich individuals in question.	you would need to end the tribal conflicts.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	so claiming that the government only  helped  but was not responsible for the creation of the internet is just plain false.
The problem of evil in philosophy.	therefore, god must permit these hardships for some reason.	we ca not judge god is actions or reasoning because we lack infinite perspective.
Immorality of not paying taxes.	and if you do not participate fully, you are an immoral person ?	people are not going to voluntarily give money away in order to support society.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	you are not born with knowledge of your specific religion, and you only get to that religion by hearing about it.
Smoking Ban and Usage Drop-Off.	so i feel like an idiot for believing that if smoking were to be banned, there would be a rapid drop off in usage.	taking a highly addictive, completely legal, widely used substance and declaring it illegal will just make millions of americans into overnight criminals.
Online dating and its advantages for busy professionals.	also, people are incentivized to put their best foot and face forward on dating sites, so the physical and mental level of attractiveness offline often does not match up to a person is profile.	 attracting people does not mean you are attracting the right people.
Disappointment with the Functionality of Little Squares for Food.	all of those little squares are perfect to grab and hold butter syrup, fruit, nutella, whipped cream, or whatever delicious food you put on top.	this sounds like it would be in true, but unfortunately, it is not.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	mostly its a picture of a person or a scene.
Effects of Spanking on Children's Thinking and Behavior	spanking does not encourage critical thinking: child a:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy will hit me  child b:  i better not do that because daddy/mommy explained x will happen.	sorry but i do not believe you.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	whilst emotions can be useful, they can also be misleading.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	once you get exposed to ideas, then you can consider people as  believing  specific ideas are wrong.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	but we will buy into that just for the sake of discussion here, because i like the idea of examining the first error above.
The ethics of giving to the homeless.	why should i give a homeless person food or money ?	your idea of evil is a very short term strategy and i am in it for the long game.
Morality and obligation of donating money to a group.	why should i feel morally obligated to give my money to these people to do mostly terrible things because a group of people decided that i should ?	arguably, you have more of a say in this group than others because you have money and own a business.
Debate on the morality of homosexuality.	that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it is not at all about procreation.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	if we were emotionless creatures, i would have no problems with casual sex.
Different interests in global and popular culture.	i take an active interest in world news, but have no interest in popular culture.	they are not anti capitalist nor anti consumerist, sweden has one of the freest markets in europe and hell, they created ikea which is the prime example of mass produced, cheap goods that do not last long.
Subjectivity of Monetary Value and Understanding Price Determination Systems.	that is, i think that monetary value is inherently subjective and that we do not usefully understand the systems that determine the price of a good, or an appropriate salary for work performed.	this is essentially communism.
Sexual abuse of teenagers by adults.	not every adult using their  age advantage  to force teenagers to have sex with them.	some guys openly said that they want to have sex with someone, even if someone is much older than they are.
The impact of animals on human survival.	animals die all the time, extinct species are simply replaced by new ones.	there is a lot of science to back this up.
Reading habits of Reddit users.	most reddit users skim comments at best and do not bother to read low enough or read down voted threads.	see, i read this and go  ah, only the trolls and the extremists go through  eleven thousand  comments to find this racist gem.
The impact of public figures on society's perspective.	i do not understand being offended by one person is opinion.	however, i think your apathy of the consequence or possible not even realizing the consequence is the issue at hand.
Motivation for Suicide	secondly, the drive to commit suicide is provided by one is mis perception of being a burden, and so the motivation for killing oneself is obviously and inescapably altruistic and selfless.	the motivation could not possibly be just a simple,  i do not want to live anymore  ? i would find that to be such an eminently worthy reason to kill oneself.
Disadvantages of smoking and the issue of respect.	i ca not see any reason for a rational person to smoke.	now, barring the fact that i can make this argument for anything i disagree with, ad infinitum, why do you relate smoking and respect ? do you relate respect to those who drink as well ? how about those with differing political beliefs ? no, as someone who does not smoke, you probably ca not.
Discipline and Spanking in Children's Behavior.	kids these days are unruly and need to be taught discipline !	this is not a pro or anti spanking observation.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	that would cause great tensions and possibly wars.
The meaning of "God" in the context of religion.	change my view that god should represent the shared human concept of existence for people who claim to be religious, as anything less thought out than that basically implies that the word  god  has no more meaning within the framework of our reality.	thus, we should use a definition for god that includes jesus christ, allah, vishnu, thor, zeus, etc.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	the old bumper sticker slogan goes  in , any englishman could carry a firearm, yet crime was so rare that bobbies rarely carried a gun.
Atheism and the Path to Finding God	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	because there is no evidence, apart from the bible, of his existence.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	even if a given bartender knows what goes in these drinks, they might not have the ability to produce one.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	this is because millions of people, like you, decided that it did not make sense to pay $ for music that was a click away on your computer.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	actually, the chinese were taught to use chopsticks long before spoons and forks were invented in europe the knife is older, not as an instrument for dining but as weapon.
Comparison of federal government services to companies and state institutions.	the federal government is better at services than any company or state institution can be.	another assumption without any justification whatsoever.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	have you explored philosophical defenses of religion ? there are books worth of recent literature that defends the definition i provided.
Disadvantages of smoking and the issue of respect.	i ca not see any reason for a rational person to smoke.	some of my friends are drinkers, but i ca not resist reproaching them for their addiction.
Burden of proof in legal cases.	in most other cases, when the situation becomes a he said she said argument, one side would need to provide some sort of proof in order to have the law side with them.	libel ? often very subjective.
Essential drinks for bartenders.	i just picked three, but there are more.	i see a contradiction between these statements.
Transgender struggle and its comparison to other minority struggles.	i do not think the trans struggle is on the same level as that of homosexuals and racial minorities.	it becomes a choice between living with the gender dysphoria or living with the not so simple task of getting society to accept you as your target gender.
Individuality and Equal Opportunity in Society	i do not want the same as others, i want a chance to fulfill my own dreams and objectives.	and you can be free to pursue that within reason.
The negative effects of persuasive advertising.	these techniques have been used to great effect in the past century to peddle all kinds of harmful products to the public, including cigarettes, alcohol, and sugary processed foods that have led to an influx in childhood obesity, adult obesity, cancer, heart disease, etc.	as long as they do not promise anything false, than it is fine.
Gender Equality and Chivalry	i do not think you can have gender equality and chivalry coexist.	division of labor is something that allowed our species to survive and thrive.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	here is a good site URL showing some stats related to both.
Government compensation for descendants of slaves.	i believe detroit would be much more developed if black people received checks from the government.	there are not any black people still living who were slaves, so it does not make sense to offer reparations to people who were not slaves in the first place.
Outdated beliefs and animal population control.	the archaic belief in people returning to life, and even the belief that dead would feel insulted if not  properly respected  is outdated and a fallacy.	very often natural populations of animals get out of control and can destroy an environment.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	second, corporations have to pay tons of incidental fees, regulatory costs, and payroll taxes taxation on the payment of employees.
Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	if women wants to compete in regular tournament circuit, she can.
Subjectivity of Monetary Value and Understanding Price Determination Systems.	that is, i think that monetary value is inherently subjective and that we do not usefully understand the systems that determine the price of a good, or an appropriate salary for work performed.	the reason it would not and has not worked is that value is subjective.
Reducing genetic diversity.	i do not consider reduction of genetic diversity a real problem.	so why assume that my kids would ? that is good for you, but much like people who ignore global warming, the problem does not disappear because you do not understand it.
Confidence and its implications.	i feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions.	there is nothing wrong with question your own position if new information becomes available.
Federal government's control and protection.	so why does the federal government get to control so much ?	protect from whom ? from businesses ? from states ? from racists ? your terminology is vague.
Tax incentives and currency choice.	i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.	that value comes from the people behind it, the citizens and tax payers of the u.
Fantasy character interactions and offspring.	if two of the characters get married, i want to see the ridiculous offspring of my roommate and jennifer lawrence for example.	there is a tonne of silly scenarios that could arise if they included gay marriage.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	you know the ones i am talking about: dances with wolves, pocahontas, etc.
Identification of man-made causes for various phenomena.	all claims i have ever seen that  more or less of x is caused by man !	bam you just controlled nature.
Using chopsticks.	if you do pick something up with them, you have keep your hand tense so the chop sticks are held closer together.	how so ? that is not their purpose.
Government's role in marriage.	which made me ask, why the government was even involved in marriage in the first place.	it is the same reason the government works to give you clean air, reduces noises, provides transportation avenues, and supports public education.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	if that is not to your liking, though, you could take fewer econ classes and more of other interesting classes, like psychology or statistics.
Job satisfaction and following dreams.	i think people place too much emphasis on job satisfaction.	then following your dreams would be to figure out the best way to make  figures in the art field.
Uncertainty about future career path.	i do not plan on being a chemist, nor do i plan on becoming a mathematician.	high school is free, so why not try these subjects out ? you will never get a chance to learn chemistry for free in your life.
Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	so if women do not compete with men, its not because of sexism, its because they lack competence of top male players.
Taxation and Government Spending.	despite all of this, i am meticulous about paying my taxes, because i fear the consequences of getting caught.	however, i do absolutely exploit every single tax incentive that i can find to not pay one single penny more than i have to.
Drug use and altering one's state of mind.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	but altering your mind is what drives me.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	throughout german occupied poland, such atrocities were becoming commonplace.
Career choices and following dreams.	if i just love the arts and want to go to school for theatre or sculpture or something, but i also wish to make six figures in my life, i should be made aware that i have probably picked the wrong career path.	this may be your dream, but not everyone cares about making  figures and thus not everyone necessarily dreams of making  figures.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	rich people will still want to be special, so the best genes will be prohibitively expensive while the rest of us get lesser genes.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	war and peace is also famously boring for a lot of people, but it is still a masterpiece that deserves the attention it gets more than a century after it was written.
Pizza sizes and confusion.	my point is that when places like dominos and pizza hut sell you s, m, l pies, you have no way to know what you are getting.	also, since you are not really arguing about the thickness i will leave this as it is as there is much less ambiguity in how thick a style of pizza will be.
Religion and Evil People.	evil, twisted people, but still just mortal people.	it is a specific example of the tangible results of dogmatic beliefs.
Atheism as Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	the use of atheism as a lack of belief has been around for a long time, and is not a non standard definition.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	there have been many great kings and queens throughout history who have led there people to prosperity.
Atheism vs Agnosticism.	b atheism is mutually exclusive with agnosticism.	we say  i do not know  when it comes to unproven science.
Argument for legalizing all crimes to save money.	why not make all crimes legal, then the police do not need to exist and we save all the money !	how many people sell tobacco on the black market ? you can do drugs without victimizing others or putting them into danger.
Comparing language difficulty and importance of knowing native language.	latin languages have conjugations, slavic languages have conjugations and declensions.	what is your native language ? found later in the comments that your native language is french, i ask because you ca not call a language easy or difficult to learn without knowing a person is native language or other languages they speak proficiently.
Origins and significance of "Deutschlandlied"	deutschlandlied is a song of unity, peace, and brotherhood from the very first stanza.	i mean, the actual song is very good, probably my second favorite national anthem after god save the queen, but the references are so antiquated and out of date.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	that might result in the parent missing a rent payment and having to pay a late fee.
Caution towards women and statistics.	the general counter argument or point of caution lobbied towards women is not one of blame, but of wariness.	most rapes happen between the hours of pm and midnight, and the least occur between midnight and am.
Native American culture and its influence on modern society.	the people are gone, their land is gone, and their culture has almost no influence in our daily lives.	this is much the same as native american utilization of the crop, and corn as we know it today ears with kernels was directly developed by native american cultures.
Criticism of the free market and Luxottica's business practices.	that is not how the free market should work.	if everyone is benefiting from their products, what is the problem ? if this is a free market monopoly, i see nothing wrong with it.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	it would be so hot you would die, with no low tech means to cool you down.
Opinions on Acting Skill and Roleplaying.	i find bad acting very cringey, and i do not act well so trying out roleplaying/watching other people act badly does not appeal to me.	i tend to act a little bit, but if it is horrible we lampshade it, laugh, and move on.
Gender identity and expression.	can any male ever truly know what its like to be a female, and express any desire for that state of mind ?	how can anyone  feel  like they should be something other than what they are ? but they never do change their state of mind.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	but does that not debase the sanctity of marriage itself if you reduce it solely to that ? which is what the catholic church is doing in my opinion.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	so, following this chain, i assert that video games are not sexist so much as adolescent video game playing males are sexist.
Animal exploitation and consent argument.	the only way the consent argument can be strong is if you are arguing from the standpoint we should not exploit animals period.	it comes back to the golden rule; treat them as you would like to be treated if you were in their shoes.
Gender differences in aggression and competitiveness.	men tend to be more agressive than women.	and in fact there have been societies where the gender roles were reversed and women were the more aggressive and competitive group.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	the implicit assumption is that the test for to hire or not to hire is if the company is profitable.
Adaptation to environmental change and indifference towards human longevity.	i think that adapting to environmental conditions is something that humans have done for hundreds of thousands of years, and on a separate note i am not sure i care all that much if humans are around in another thousand years.	the usual methods do not work any more when temperatures and humidity go high enough, drinking enough water would not help, fans would feel more like hair dryers,.
Philosophical Writing	if you want something philosophical, i feel you should stick to essays.	a good poet considers all of these factors when selecting each individual word of a poem.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	URL it is perfectly reasonable to be upset by their policy.
Teenage driving safety and texting while driving.	teenagers are notorious for poor decision making and the rise in texting related accidents proves that teens are unable to consistently operate a car safely.	i started working at age  on a horseradish farm so i could save to buy a car.
The ending of a novel.	in the end he learns to love big brother and is finally happy, his last moment is one of complete bliss.	he has been, quite literally, mindraped.
Smoking and its rationality.	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	what good does it do you ? what good does it do them ?.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	i also believe that this is reprehensible.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	it helps to bond.
TV show plot and character development.	i literally cannot tell one episode from another and nothing feels worth watching.	i came to the feeling that this was the best show i would ever watched by myself.
Definition of atheism and common misconception.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	if god did exist, then the evidence would be incorporated into our scientific understanding of the world.
Self-determination in choosing a partner.	someone that is good enough for you.	it is not high standards that people are against as much as people having high standards then whining about no one they like wanting them.
Criticism of Libertarianism and Government Monopolies.	i see absolutely no reason why libertarianism should be tolerated as a legitimate viewpoint.	it has been proven to work.
Corporate tax cuts and their impact on large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	and we, as taxpayers, would either have to pay for the difference through our own taxes, or take cuts to other services.
Importance of musical literacy for performers.	to be a skilled performer without musical literacy is analogous to a great storyteller who neither read nor write.	i guess that people downvote you because of the bad analogy.
Negative effects of smoking.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	it will be nice for a few years, maybe even many years.
The influence of corporations on government.	due to actions like this, i think that the government of any particular country has to not allow a large business to alter the position of the government in any way, shape, or form.	is it bad that bp or the auto industry has excessive influence on government ? probably.
Gender and Intelligence in Chess.	the implication is that women are not as smart as men.	someone could make an argument that chess is less popular sport amongst women, and as such there are not as many good female players.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	i believe that a natural non sexist gap in male vs female character prevalence should thus not be surprising or necessarily bad to anyone.
Responsibility and Authority in Children's Behavior	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	it escalates into threats.
Smoking and its rationality.	i think smoking is intentional self harm and therefore everyone who smokes is kind off stupid.	they are also doing something which they believe is providing something positive effect.
Chopsticks and Soup Eating Customs.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	i mean, i guess that is true but if you are applying so much pressure that it is causing noticeable fatigue then you probably do not need that much pressure.
Discussion about a losing war and betrayal of a leader.	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	it was now a personal blood feud.
Obesity and Bad Decision Making.	both stem from bad decision making and both can be cured from better decision making.	our stomachs are dumb, and that is hard to combat; what i mean by this is that when you gain weight, your body acclimates to the level of food it takes to maintain that weight, and so if you try to eat less of the same foods, you will find yourself hungry very often.
Importance of musical literacy for performers.	to be a skilled performer without musical literacy is analogous to a great storyteller who neither read nor write.	why do you compare it with writers ? the equivalent of a writer is a composer, not a musician.
Origins and significance of "Deutschlandlied"	deutschlandlied is a song of unity, peace, and brotherhood from the very first stanza.	at this point, you might as well sing  gott erhalte franz den kaiser  because even though the song is hyping some austrian emperor, at least those lyrics are not associated with nazis.
Preference between cats and dogs as pets.	cats, even when used to human contact, will frequently attack a human without reason as  play .	personally i prefer cats as a pet because they need less work.
Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	why not make all crimes legal, then the police do not need to exist and we save all the money ! if i light up my crack pipe alone in my basement it affects you far less than if i try to rob you at gunpoint.
Generational gap in politics and policy making.	i think what we are really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation the millenials is experiencing is not the same world our parents the boomers experienced.	this is not about presidents, this is about ceos, lobbyists, and congressmen.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	meeting in secret, three assessors would then decide whether the patient should live or die.
The importance of science in society.	science is one of the fundamental building blocks of society, the thing that has allowed us to advance so much in the last two hundred years.	odd considering the majority of knowledge preserved in western society was done so in christian monasteries and muslim libraries.
Patriarchy in Western Society	patriarchy is a simple term describing a society in which fathers are the heads of families, men are the heads of tribes and governments, etc; descent is traced through the male line; and so forth.	we all know they are mostly teenage, uneducated nutcases.
Identity and Subjectivity	the mental and the physical is what makes us people, there are no other objective factors that make you, you.	for instance, notice how  limited  the chosen metrics are   iq and raw physical strength.
The effectiveness of vaccinations.	the evidence for the efficacy of vaccinations is overwhelming and the benefits far outweigh the potential risks.	your view relies heavily on a  there is only one truth  perspective.
Resilience and Violence as Solutions to Problems.	i think being less sensitive and more resilient is a good thing.	if you stay on your current op path, how likely do you think it is that you go too far and damage your kid in some of the ways above ? how likely is it that you nail it perfectly ? if you do not beat your kid and discourage crying, how likely do you think it is that he is going to be the nervous wreck you fear ?.
Thomistic perspective on natural law and homosexuality.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	which it is not.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	it is one thing to recite facts, it is another to be able to actually understand and apply them.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	now we have a new race of rich people with better genes, and normal people with normal genes.
Designer genetics and competition in sports.	their dna would be edited to become the most beautiful people many have ever seen !	a certain type of beauty will become the designer standard, and they will merely blend in with the rest of the population.
Psychopathy as a mental illness.	rodger left a lucid, coherent explanation of his crimes.	lucid and coherent explanations have nothing to do with lack of mental illness.
Interpretation of the Constitution's purpose.	the federal government only needs to protect our rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.	a stock market crash in new york will not just make new york destitute, but every place that does business in or with new york, which is most of the world and the entirety of the us.
Limitations of Poetry in Subject Matter	i feel poetry fails to combine these two elements diversely, and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	whether you like it is not really relevant, i suppose, as long as you understand that poetry can be both well respected and not fall into your two categories.
Withdrawal from Cannabis Classification on Website	while withdrawal from cannabis has absolutely no drawbacks.	symptoms of  withdrawal  from it include lack of sleep, loss of appetite, irritation, etc.
Qualities of a military commander.	even his reputation as military commander is inflated.	there was the religion of the old gods in westeros.
Impact of British Empire on Third World and Hitler's Expansion Plans.	but the british empire was the largest and the loss of their territories set back much of the third world by decades.	so you are arguing that colonialism was good for the rd world ? certainly an interesting position to take and one that most people would disagree with.
Poetry's Relevance and Themes.	and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	how words are placed on the page is actually very important.
Robb's double standards and his mother's influence in the war.	he also has a bad case of double standards.	when they go to their knees, however, you must help them back to their feet.
Income inequality and its effects on society.	in the countries which have the least income inequality the scandinavian countries and japan crime and poverty are reduced, but birth rates are unusually low and depression is high.	higher rates of  diagnosed  mental illness seem to be indicators of a developed sociaty, rather than being caused by equality.
Casual sex and risk-taking behavior.	thirdly, casual sex is a form of risk taking behavior.	the  thrill  of unknown partners can easily manifest itself in other vices.
Transgender struggle and its comparison to other minority struggles.	i do not think the trans struggle is on the same level as that of homosexuals and racial minorities.	transgender people who choose to transition may struggle with the issue of passing as their target gender in a social context, how people will perceive them, whether or not they will be fired from their job if they come out, whether or not they will one day find a significant other who finds them attractive, etc.
Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	the fact that so much of the outcry was over the damage done to the lives of the accused tells us that our society does not expect to punish young men for that kind of behaviour.
Correlation between test scores and preparation methods.	however, there is a very strong correlation between act/sat scores and the amount of time/money put into preparing for them.	this can be proved with any prep class with a  higher score or your money back  guarantee i disagree.
Biodiversity and the Loss of Animal Species.	in terms of biodiversity, i do not see the problem with losing some animal species, and from my limited understanding of biology eventually a different ecosystem would take the place of what we have now.	so you are still looking at a very large proportion of all life on earth going extinct.
Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	so its not really adding more bad substances to the mix, its more a question of admitting that people are going to want to do this stuff regardless of legality, so why continue fighting it and spending billions of dollars that can be better spent ?.
Preference for Western Silverware over Chopsticks for Asian Cuisine.	in sum: i believe that chopsticks are terrible eating utensils for a lot of reasons, and i should not be judged when i opt to use western silverware when i eat asian cuisine.	if i am in a very asian restaurant, perhaps in k town, i drink out of the bowl.
Importance of Proper Communication in Job Interviews	i am pretty sure i could not have even gotten an interview if i spoke like lil  montrell up the street haha.	speak like a professional adult, get treated like a professional adult.
Morality and Personal Associations.	that does not make a person a shitty human being.	i get opportunities you never will, simply because those opportunities require the trust of people you think you are smart enough to fool but you are not.
***Argument over a topic.	talking about unicorns or teapots or such.	you also take positions which are in conflict with one another.
***Difficulties in discussing sensitive social topics in the US.	with all efforts to educate myself on topics such as obamacare, transgender, along with other major social topics in the us, there was always someone to  put me in my place  because of how much i offended them.	and then they claimed to be victims because of that, and because they do not  agree with obama, it is such a shame, they are the ones who get attacked and called racist.
Debate on the Value of Religion.	my argument against religion is that its good qualities can all be found elsewhere.	whilst i encourage a particular set of cognitive tools for learning and assessing ie.
Smoking and societal attitudes towards it.	i do not understand why people are so against smoking these days.	at what point are you looking at in their life ? again these problems are not present the moment you start smoking, they accumulate over time.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	atheism is lacking belief in a god, but not claiming that no god exists.
Responsibility and Spanking of Young Children.	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	many children are incredibly young less than  when they start getting spanked.
Renly's chances of having children.	and renly does not have terribly great chances of having children.	how can you say he would not get it done ? he is young yet, give him time.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	this is exactly as immoral as using any form of birth control.
Smoking and Personal Choice.	i think i should be allowed to smoke.	these issues are cumulative.
Blaming for infidelity and aiding in ruining someone's life.	i would be absolutely devastated, but i would not act like the faceless guy who she had an affair with was all to blame.	if you did not know, you would not be in the wrong because you simply had a sexual encounter with someone.
Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	going swimming outside.
Teenage driving safety.	and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	anyways, there are a couple simple reasons i believe the driving age is fine at , and actually is fine for people to start driving even earlier.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	smokers do not have these excuses.
Sports dominance and soccer as a release valve.	i think that soccer is a great release valve for the rest of the world.	you do not seem to understand that soccer is a huge sport in the us, just not as big as many other sports.
Participation trophies and their impact on young minds.	i think, along with this, that participation trophies are bad for young minds, for the same reason.	also, i am not gonna be some crazy dad one day who makes his kids be pro athletes and jump their ass about everything, and i know that in extra curriculars, the most important thing is having fun.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	they are only emotions, not facts.
Cutting corporate taxes to boost the economy.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	i am from australia, where the government/corporate culture is very different to that of the us.
Human fetus and the use of the word "potential".	human fetus is a stage in the life of a human being.	there is evidence that lasting memories and identity do not start for form until  and a half years.
The limitations of natural law in ethical arguments.	i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	i just hope they get better, faster.
The cost of being a superpower.	if we were no longer a superpower, we would not have to spend billions of dollars being be the policeman for other countries and trying and often failing to spread democracy elsewhere.	such as on education, healthcare, innovation, etc.
Oppression of Historical Nobility System.	the system of nobility is historically oppressive.	individuals who are nobles today have a lot of wealth based on a historical system in which a very small % of the population had unfair power over the rest of society.
Limitations of Poetry in Subject Matter	i feel poetry fails to combine these two elements diversely, and most of the poems that are praised only revolve around the two topics stated: love and hardship.	most well respected poems in academia broach a wide array of topics: civil rights, gender identity, metafiction, consciousness etc.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	now we are stuck in a world with hugely expensive data/text/voice plans because there is no real competition.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	you get assignments you have to complete, and you get evaluated on your output.
Disagreement on the idea of proportional electoral system.	signed commitment to support a proportional electoral system with your vote.	i would be surprised if you got many politicians to sign up for it, let alone voters.
Future MMORPG games and their immersive experience.	most of mmorpg games thats coming in future will be much better then what i have played before.	but do not expect the newer games to give you more satisfaction than you are getting now.
Negative effects of technology dependence.	too much technological convenience becomes a dependence, makes you weaker mentally and physically, and less capable than you otherwise would have been.	let is say you are paid to hand out newspapers and you usually take your route by foot.
Grades and job preparedness.	students are coddled and are not prepared for when grades do not exist and their jobs are at stake.	until we understand why, we ca not assuredly claim that too many a grade students are unworthy of their evaluations.
Baker refusing to make cake for polygamous marriage.	what if a baker refused to make a cake for a polygamous marriage ?	frankly, there are not even wedding cakes.
Philosophy and Science's Relationship.	many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.	actually, i would say the best students are those that engage in interdisciplinary studies.
Career uncertainty in economics and social development.	i like economics but i am not sure if that is what i want to study, i would love to work in social development or something similar, but economics at an undergraduate level seems like the wrong choice.	i assume you are referring to macroeconomics studying flow of money through large scale systems like states and countries , rather than microeconomics small scale, like within a household or a small business.
Paid paternity leave and funding for early childhood development.	rather than have the market have to take the cost of new fathers, we should have a transfer of funds to early childhood development and new parenting aid.	to not give men this leave we are essentially downgrading men in their role as parents and reinforcing their role as provider, both of which are bullshit social constructs.
Limitations of simulating consciousness in a theoretical world.	i understand that theoretically all of the particles that make up my brain and the world could be simulated, but those simulations could lead to the same conclusions even assuming there was no consciousness.	it is a leap of intuition that i am unable to make to consider that my consciousness exists because of a massive store of clay tablets.
Sports scheduling and player fatigue.	if player fatigue is an issue, create separate play periods with rest time inbetween.	there are rest periods, but a soccer team is only allowed  substitutions over the course of the entire game.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	the obnoxious customers know  exactly  what they are doing, so hardly them being stupid.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	regardless of how much they are making, your piracy is still a cut into that revenue.
Reasons for Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain's involvement.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	you think decolonisation was a bad thing ? do you know anything about the abuses of empire ? it is a very positive outcome of the war, that britain lost her colonies, that france lost her colonies, that germany did not become a new empire in itself.
Income inequality and its effects on society.	in the countries which have the least income inequality the scandinavian countries and japan crime and poverty are reduced, but birth rates are unusually low and depression is high.	maybe in a more equal world, world population would end up stabilizing at one billion or less.
Effectiveness of Advertising.	i have never watched or listened to an advert, then gone and bought something as a result.	you do not need to do that for advertising to work.
Capitalism and its limitations.	for another, competition becomes impractical after a point; try starting an isp, or a car company, or a petrochemical company.	what do you think would happen if we did not have these laws which favoured others ? capitalism teaches us that accumulation of wealth is the ultimate goal.
Criteria for Involuntary Admission Scheduling.	note that criteria for involuntary admission scheduling varies between states and countries but generally includes risk of harm to self, or to others.	being stupid and/or ignorant is not the same thing as being delusional.
Caution towards women and statistics.	the general counter argument or point of caution lobbied towards women is not one of blame, but of wariness.	the thing is, statistics do not really support the point of wariness.
Intelligence vs. Grades	i have heard the  i know stupid people with good grades  argument and i do not understand that.	drangle and dougle through the process of xarckle it is entirely possible for someone to get good grades by doing what i have just done, except for an entire class.
Libertarianism and State vs Federal Government.	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	states are smaller, which makes it easier for individual states to make social improvements/changes like legalizing marijuana or gay marriage.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	it is very much as important or more important to everyone is lives as telephone service, so why do we not regulate it as we do telephones ?.
Difference of opinion.	however, i feel that many people i have met do not agree with me.	do not listen to losers.
Income sources of popular artists.	from popular artists that already make millions of dollars from their concert, endorsements and record sales.	if you were to stop pirating all music, that would not affect the millions of other pirates out there.
The usefulness of converting moles of oxygen into grams.	i cannot think of a single moment in my life where someone will ask me to convert moles of oxygen into grams.	however, there is overwhelming benefit to exposing children to information.
Comparison of regular birth control pills and Plan B.	why should regular daily pill birth control be any different ?	oral hormonal birth control pills bcp is a routine regimen and consists of a wide variety of compositions: progestagen only, progestagen and estranes of varying doses, progestagen and estranes of titrating doses, corticosteroids with progestogenic effects, and etc.
Exclusion of medical conditions in defining obesity.	my argument does not include those overweight because of medical conditions, i am merely referring to those who are overweight or obese because of lifestyle decisions.	it is more along the lines of  be happy with who you are.
Gun control and public safety.	the more guns there are in public places, the more gun violence there will be.	where do you pull that conclusion from ? who is going to protect me ? the sever with the spoon of justice ? where is that tid bit of fact come from ?.
Debate on the role of evidence in finding God.	if so, why would the atheist think the way to finding god should be through enlightenment scientific empirical evidence when the text specifically say the path to god is through trust/faith ?	equals     reworded   why would one group of people say that knowledge requires evidence when another group of people say knowledge does not require evidence ? which group of people to believe ? and the answer ultimately is neither.
Faith and the nature of God.	if so, you will never find it, because that is not how god works.	because in order to accept the fact that faith is necessary, faith must be put into the text to begin with.
Corporate Taxation and its Impact on Small Businesses.	the theory: cutting taxes on corporations creates jobs and boosts the economy.	the bigger, more international companies are in the best position to evade taxes or move to a location with lower taxes, so higher corporate taxes largely hurt smaller corporations more than larger ones.
Sexual exclusivity in trust agreement.	why is sexual exclusivity part of the general trust agreeement ?	it is important to both of us.
The relationship between confidence and learning.	in short, confidence inhibits learning, while self doubt gives every opportunity for self edification.	confidence is readiness to act on information, or feeling.
Gender differences and individual variation.	however, the sexes are not the same, men are better at some things on average strength, speed, spatial reasoning skills, being unifluenced by emotion just as woman are better at others caregiving, emotional empathy, interpersonal communication .	if a woman is capable of frontline fitness requirement, that is fine.
Responsibility and Authority in Children's Behavior	children are a cognitively disabled part of society: how can you be held responsible for your actions if you do not understand consequence ?	did not you just say children do not have the ability to think critically ? critical thinking is not the goal.
Reducing genetic diversity.	i do not consider reduction of genetic diversity a real problem.	history tells us time after time after time that reduction in the genetic diversity of a species leads to extinction.
Atheism as the Default Position	a some claim that atheism is the default position.	additionally criticism only needs to reference the original claims to be valid.
Casual sex and the risk of STDs.	firstly, you never know if the random person at a nightclub is  clean .	besides, in a friends with benefit style relationship, people presumably trust their partner to tell them if they have an std, making this a much smaller risk  secondly, it is unproductive and time wasting, and can lead to other even more unproductive and costly behaviors like binge drinking and internet addiction browsing hookup sites.
Designer genetics and the desire for a star athlete child.	i hope to tweak/upgrade his/her dna to make our kid a star athlete.	not everything can be improved with no consequences.
Sexualization of Nudity and Violence on TV.	young teenagers over sexualize nudity due to the rather complete restriction on it, which has now swung rather far the other way with the extent of internet pornagraphy.	i am pretty sure all teenagers at least males love nudity.
Human adaptability and survival.	humans will simply adapt and move on, we are an incredibly resourceful species and have collectively survived or overcome every single challenge posed to us.	well we are adapting by beginning to care about the climate.
Existential anxiety and fear of death.	the idea of dying and not existing is distant but very real and haunts me at times.	period.
Affirmative Action Policy	affirmative action is purpose is to level the playing field and give each student a chance at college, no matter the student is background.	if you know people with certain traits yourself, your expectations wo not be solely shaped by prejudice.
Discussion about a losing war and betrayal of a leader.	so given the facts, you are in a losing war, you leader is incompetent and unhonorable, who would not betray him ?	tywin lannister what made the red wedding tactically brilliant but strategically foolish was the blatancy of the betrayal, violation of guest right, and murder of countless other northern and riverlander nobles.
The potential benefits of tax cuts for large companies.	with that said, the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like walmart, mcdonald is, etc.	who is paying a corporation is tax ? URL  but there are two important issues you need to know about corporation taxes:  first, a corporations  income is double taxed.
Fear of Eternal Sleep.	the thought of my consciousness fading into a deep, never ending sleep just terrifies me.	this happens to you  every day  when you fall asleep.
Disagreement with federal budget allocation.	but looking at the federal budget in the us, a huge portion of the things my taxes go to are things i absolutely do not agree with.	i still respect and agree with the general system of taxation.
Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	and i think it is safe to assume that most people have never heard of most of them, their people, culture, none of it.
Theoretical limits of modeling particles in the universe.	theoretically speaking, if methuselah lived long enough and had enough clay tablets he could perform all of the calculations necessary to model all of the particles in the universe.	if we are living in a simulation, it is the same situation.
Moral dilemma between protecting life and acquiring power/happiness.	he must choose between what he believes to be right protecting human life and his selfish desires to acquire money and in turn power/happiness.	he only desires money and happiness  if he is earned it.
Causes of WWII and Lebensraum concept.	germany invaded poland to gain a route to the sea danzig .	it is disingenuous as hell to pretend that the blame for the war can be laid upon  diplomatic blunders.
Comparison of federal government services to companies and state institutions.	the federal government is better at services than any company or state institution can be.	another baseless assertion  the prison system needs to be federalized pronto, to crack down on violence.
Career advancement based on obedience rather than intelligence and hard work.	every place i work the people who seem to progress the fastest are not the most inteligent and hardworking, but the most obedient.	how is that them being stupid ? given a system used to evaluate something, the people who come out on top are always those who understand the system and know how to game it, be it grades, sat scores, promotions, etc.

Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	i wonder if they know that openly trans people in the us military still can be discharged in a post dadt military, as briefly explained in this article URL it has made no logical sense to me when gay people claim that trans people co opt or ride on the coattails of the gay community when you see how many gay people hold that opinion.

The limitations of deriving meaning from criminal behavior.	that being said, to try to derive anything exceptionally deep or meaningful about society from any of these things i do not think is particularly useful.	people missing half their brain teaches us a lot about the brain.
Proof of God's existence through logic.	god can also be proven via logic if defined correctly.	it absolutely is.

Teaching boys not to rape.	mostly with the idea that we have to  teach boys not to rape .	i think that misses the point rape culture is not about what is hard coded into the male identity; rather, it is a movement against a cultural landscape that implicitly teaches boys and men that they are entitled to sex from women.
Chopsticks and Soup Eating Customs.	third, because chopsticks ca not deliver broth from the bowl of soup to the user is mouth, chopstick users particularly in asian countries will slurp the broth directly from the bowl.	this should not actually be a problem, and if it is the dish was not meant to be eaten with chopsticks.
Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	in my mind, game makers are making the games that sell to the demographics they target.

Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	do you really think that people are gonna just stop doing drugs because of that ? they are not, people are always going to do drugs, so it makes more sense to legalize, tax, and regulate them.

Baker refusing to make cake for polygamous marriage.	what if a baker refused to make a cake for a polygamous marriage ?	while the market may stamp out many business due to their bigotry that does not change the fact that in many cases such businesses will be able to limp on creating a situation where patrons of certain classes will always be wondering whether or not they are going to get served or turned away simply because of their identity.
Gun control and repealing the Second Amendment.	i believe that we need to repeal the second amendment and forcibly confiscate and destroy all firearms in american households.	if the government is allowed to mobilize the army against the population for this right, what other rights will they go after once this one has been taken ? do not just say that the current administration or whoever wo not abuse the power.
Causes of WWII and Hitler's intentions for westward invasion.	hitler had no intention of invading westward until britain declared war on germany.	the invasion plans for france were being drafted before he invaded poland.

The dangers of blind faith in religion.	blind faith is a dangerous force that religion encourages.	with or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.

Self defense shootings and the definition of a militia.	there is also the occasional case of a successful self defense shooting.	and that is the naivete at play, that a disarmed populace means less violent crime.
Interest in moral, ethical, and philosophical issues.	i am more interested in the moral, ethical and philosophical issues rather than in practical ones.	how are you, you.
Dressing conservatively to reduce chances of unwanted attention.	but i think if you dress like a whore you increase your chances.	again how you dress is not putting yourself in the situation.
Sexual frustration and monogamy.	sexually unsuccessful males have a strong tendency to not accept being condemned to genetic extinction, and instead tend to act out and cause problems for society such as mass shootings a la eliot rodger and rape.	however, the reasons why i do not find polyamory appealing are personal, they have to do mostly with feelings and not evolution.
Society's tendency towards outrage culture.	we live in a society where politicians and people on social media feign outrage, or are actually outraged and offended over every misstatement or slip of the tongue.	you think those who like chocolate ice cream are morons ? then you are making a statement about others, and it gets weighed differently.
Comparison of Japan's acknowledgement of genocide and Germany's acknowledgement of the Holocaust.	and the japanese wo not even acknoledge the genocide in the same way germany does with the holocaust, that is just rubbing salt in the wound.	so the only two reasons you give that china would want to go to war with japan are reasons that have existed for  years and have been waning significantly over those  years.
Eliminating the use of the word "potential" in reference to humans.	as a last point, what else, if not a human ?	we do not call them butterflies until they come out of the cocoon.

Disagreeing with the Reasonableness of Agnosticism or Skepticism.	agnosticism, uncertainty or skepticism are reasonable responses to lack of evidence.	you could have chosen any dictionary to proclaim as the standard, yet you seemingly cherry picked the one dictionary which does not reflect current usage.
Catholic perspective on homosexuality and natural law.	as a devout catholic, i subscribe to the thomistic perspective on natural law, that is, that homosexuality is wrong based on the fact that procreation between members of the same sex is impossible, and therefore should be discouraged.	i would recommend looking up the church is current views on this.
Bitcoin as a currency.	but my biggest problem with bitcoin is this.	bitcoin is already being used as a currency in many different places.
The implications of defining God on the rift between atheists and theists.	there is no defined chained of events controlled by anyone.	belief in libertarian free will is far more common in religious circles than in atheistic personal experience.
Philosophy and Science's Relationship.	many problems outlined by philosophy can only be solved by modern science.	and physics is not ? how many different interpretations of quantum mechanics URL are there again ? tell me how practical the properties of the monster group URL are for my everyday life.

Discussing the portrayal of Native American heritage in culture.	my view will be changed if you can provide examples where we as a culture, in certain forums, redress and glorify our native american heritage, and admit the atrocities of men like andrew jackson, instead of praising their  pioneering spirit .	the conquerors owe nothing to the conquered, period, any concession or comfort they receive is far above and beyond what must be done which is in fact nothing at all.
Debate on the definition of atheism.	e an argument i have been hearing a lot of lately states that everyone is atheist as everyone denies some god notice the uncapitalised usage, which changes the definition or another.	what sort of evidence would you accept ? while this might be true of some religious persons, i am interdenominational.
Controversy over the inclusion of transgender in the LGBT movement.	i have a few gay friends that resent the lgbt acronym and transgendered peoples   uninvited  inclusion with the gay movement.	i wonder how many of your gay friends know that the hrc, one of most important pro gay groups in the struggle for gay rights, made a calculated decision not to include helping trans people because it might hurt the gay cause.

Raising the driving age and preventing texting while driving.	i think raising the driving age would make driving safer overall and would also discourage teenagers from participating in illegal activities such as underage drinking and illegal drug use.	more laws, and less freedom is not a good answer for some simple security.

Paid paternity leave and funding for early childhood development.	rather than have the market have to take the cost of new fathers, we should have a transfer of funds to early childhood development and new parenting aid.	let is assume for a second that the results of paid paternity leave are as you say i doubt it but i am no expert by any means and so i could be wrong.
Climate change.	my stance is that the earth is not going anywhere.	and the more pessimistic estimates like  °c would probably mean the end of humanity.
Subjectivity of Monetary Value and Understanding Price Determination Systems.	that is, i think that monetary value is inherently subjective and that we do not usefully understand the systems that determine the price of a good, or an appropriate salary for work performed.	if there is only one of something and you and i both want it how do we decide who gets it ? in a market economy whoever will pay more gets the item.
"Improving Profitability and Education's Purposes"	system as a whole to a more profitable practice i would love to hear the methodology.	are you saying that education has not benefited society ? that is a very ignorant view point.

***Topic: The irrationality of atheism.	god is empirically verifiable via prayer, entheogens, meditation, nde is URL and, of course, death.	evidence of god is frequently achieved be it via ecstatic spiritual experience or logic, innate knowledge or etc , and is likely replicable via proper experimentation a life of prayer and contemplation, love for god   neighbor, yoga / meditation, entheogens, nde is and death, for instance.
Legalization of drugs.	if drugs were legal then the police would have more time to stop other illegal things, and we could save money !	either way, i do not envision drug legalization becoming a situation where you and your friends are deciding between a bottle of jack daniels or a gram of meth for your friday night.
Job dissatisfaction and management issues.	my managers overlook how much i help the company and how loyal i am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, i  talk back  too much.	you are not cut out for that type of job, but you should not crap all over the people who are.
Comparison of federal government services to companies and state institutions.	the federal government is better at services than any company or state institution can be.	you have provided no evidence for this assertion.

Password Security and Formula Usage.	ideally, passwords should not be reused, and a formula should be used to generate unique passwords for each account you have.	but even then the fact you were generating using an algorithm, rather than pure cryptographically secure randomness, would  very significantly  narrow the search space.
Libertarianism and Social Liberalism	i feel that libertarians are mostly selfish ingrates who either hate the poor or do not care about anybody who is not a straight white person from a well off background.	many libertarians believe in social liberalism, including equal rights for all sexual orientations, genders, and races.
Personal stance on controlled substance use.	to alter one is state of mind by the purposeful use of a controlled substance for the explicit purpose of doing so, one must not value one is sense of self.	can drugs be a filter for experiences ? sure, but they can also provide a more heightened, intensified, and involved experience that being sober cannot provide.

Correlation between test scores and preparation methods.	however, there is a very strong correlation between act/sat scores and the amount of time/money put into preparing for them.	so while your amount of free time and money clearly affect your score, it has nothing to do with extra prep via classes and books catered towards the tests.
Human fetus and the use of the word "potential".	human fetus is a stage in the life of a human being.	this is like a caterpillar is a potential butterfly.
The impact of public figures on society's perspective.	i do not understand being offended by one person is opinion.	in the case of bush, he is a pretty important social figure who can influence the perspective of a lot of people.

Opinions on tattoos as a superficial trend.	no offense but when someone shows me a tattoo of their daughter on their bicep i do not think to myself that their daughter is going to become very special person.	although i personally would not get my potential children is faces tattooed on me, my interpretation is that their child means a lot to them, to the point where they want to commemorate that importance with a tattoo.
Net neutrality and trust in monopolies.	but if monopolies are bad, why do we trust the u. s.	who is interests are represented when corporations are fully in control ? this has already been done.
Corruption in the police force and challenges of discussing fictional entities.	even the police force is filled with nothing but self serving, crooked cops looking for extra money to look the other way.	nothing more than the self serving egotism of an idealist.
Paternity leave and feminism in the labor market.	paternity leave increase in the cost of labor market rigidity unemployment.	currently, businesses are more hesitant to hire young women at equal pay out of anticipation of having the labor be absent in the coming years.
Summer preferences and its downsides.	i feel like there are two types of people in the world: those who love summer and those who hate it.	sticky hot weather thick humid air which makes you feel like you are suffocating sweat the attitude which comes along with summer which makes everyone want to strip: not so appealing for the body conscious people.

Gender representation in video games.	tldr: with so many modern games focused on killing, i do not think its particularly sexist that game designers choose main characters who are of the sex that have been predominantly doing the killing over human history.	i feel like this nuanced point of view of  individual instances are not bad per se but they combine into something that is not good  is underrepresented in these discussions.
Origins of the Internet	while some would baselessly argue that the internet was a product of public endeavour and government research obama and al gore, for example, yet in terms of actual facts, the internet was a product of university research and private investment.	sure the government helped, but they were not responsible.
